<h2 id="hdr_1">The Purpose of this Narrative</h2>
</div>

<p>This book is intended to give the authentic story of
the famous Cave-in-Rock of the lower Ohio River, as
collected from historic and romantic sources, and to
present verified accounts of the most notorious of those
highwaymen and river pirates who in the early days of
the middle West and South filled the Mississippi basin
with the alarm and terror of their crimes and exploits.</p>

<p>All the criminals herein treated made their headquarters
at one time or another in this famous cavern.
It became a natural, safe hiding-place for the pirates
who preyed on the flatboat traffic before the days of
steamboats. It came also to serve the same purpose for
highwaymen infesting the old Natchez Trace and other
land trails north and south.</p>

<p>A century ago and more, its rock-ribbed walls echoed
the drunken hilarity of villains and witnessed the death
struggles of many a vanished man. Today this former
haunt of criminals is as quiet as a tomb. Nothing is
left in the Cave to indicate the outrages that were committed
there in the olden days.</p>

<p>One state historian of our own times—Parrish, of
Illinois—thus describes it: “The gruesome spot, which
in those old border days witnessed many a scene of
revelry and bloodshed, is today no more than a curiosity,
its past victims, white and black, forgotten. Just
below it, where, in 1801, there stood one lone cabin,
there is today a thrifty village.” In a sense the victims
have been forgotten; yet they survive in the true stories<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
of such of them as the preserved records can be made
to disclose.</p>

<p>The story of the Harpes is more than that of mere
criminals. They were arch-criminals among criminals,
apparently loving murder for its own sake. There was
a time when the whole of Kentucky and Tennessee was
terrorized at the possibility of their appearance at any
hour in any locality. Samuel Mason (or Meason) the
Wilsons, and others, measured up more nearly to the
standard of true highwaymen and pirates. If they had
lived in England their careers would have closed on
Tyburn Hill or at the rope’s end on “Execution Dock.”
The stories of James Ford show that his real classification
must forever remain largely a mystery.</p>

<p>Any history of these outlaws would doubtless be
looked upon as wild fiction unless the statements were
carefully verified by court records and contemporary
newspaper notices, and the records of early writers who
gathered the facts regarding them when these facts
were told by men and women who lived at the time the
atrocities were committed. The adage that “truth is
stranger than fiction” is exemplified fully in their
careers.</p>

<p>The lives and exploits of these men constitute an important
phase in pioneer life because their deeds greatly
affected the settlement of the new country. Dread of
them brought peaceful settlers together in communities
and helped to hasten the establishment of law and
order. Their histories are therefore a part of the history
of the country. The historian who passes them
over as mere blood-and-thunder tales misses entirely
one of the high lights in the great adventure of the
settling of the Mississippi basin.</p>

<p>Owing to the sparse population and the great distances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
between settlements in the West, the early
accounts of these criminals and their crimes were subject
to change and to the effects of terrorizing rumor.
In time the deeds of one would be attributed to another,
and the circumstances of one crime confounded with
others. In the main, however, tradition preserved a
generally consistent story. Here and there men like
James Hall and the editors of early newspapers preserved
accounts of them and so blazed the way to court
records and approximated the dates for private archives
to be consulted. The pages that follow contain the
result of years of patient investigation of these records
and of archives that have never been published.</p>

<p>Numbers in brackets inserted in the text refer to the
authorities as numbered in the bibliography.</p>

<h2 id="hdr_2">The Lair of the Outlaws</h2>
</div>

<p>Nature has set her own seal of wonder and immortality
upon some of her works. The cavern of Cave-in-Rock,
on the northern bank of the lower Ohio River,
bears such a seal. Lacking the adventitious aids of
immensity, depth, and remoteness, it was regarded with
religious interest in the vague traditions of the aborigines,
and has excited the curiosity, aroused the imagination
and stirred the fear of white men since they first
discovered it. The Cave has been at once noted and
notorious, famous and infamous, and it remains today,
through all the changing years and diversities of its
use, actual or attributed, practically unchanged, still
challenging curiosity, surprise, fear, and admiration.</p>

<p>The scenery above and below the Cave attracted the
attention of the earliest western travelers. Much deforestation
has taken place during the past century, but the
landscapes along the banks of that section of the Ohio
stand today, as they did in the olden days, unsurpassed
by any other along the river’s course. The mouth of
the Cave is in a high bluff overlooking the Ohio, which
is the central link in a chain of majestic landscapes. It
seems almost a paradox that a spot so beautified by
nature should have been made the headquarters of outlaws,
and the scene of much that was hideous in crime.</p>

<p>Pioneers in the West were likely at any time to
encounter wild animals or to be forced to battle with
plundering or revenge-seeking Indians. Whether traveling
overland trails or upon navigable streams, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
first-comers in the middle West were always in danger
of highway robbers or river pirates. The cruelest of all
highwaymen were the Harpes and the shrewdest of the
river pirates were the Masons.</p>

<p>Cave-in-Rock’s history as a rendezvous of outlaws
does not begin until about 1795. The date of the discovery
by white men has not been ascertained. The
earliest record found is in <cite>The History of New France</cite>,
by Charlevoix, in 1744. It includes Bellin’s Map of
Louisiana presenting the general course of the Ohio,
drawn from observations made by M. de Lery. When
this explorer came down the river in 1729 he noted the
location of the Cave by referring to it as “Caverne dans
le Roc.” After 1778 it is indicated on many English
and American maps. Early travelers designated it by
various names, each of which, except “House of Nature,”
contained the word “cave.” Since 1800, Cave-in-Rock
has been practically the only name applied.</p>

<p>The early French called the Ohio “La Belle Riviere.”
In the days of primeval forests it was one of
the most beautiful streams in the world. Evidences of
its former grandeur are nowhere so well retained as in
the neighborhood of Cave-in-Rock. The last of the
giants of the forests standing on the bluffs and in the
bottoms along the river will some day disappear, but
Cave-in-Rock will defy time and its changes, and ever
stand as a reminder of the days when wilderness was
king.</p>

<p>Cave-in-Rock is in Hardin County, Illinois, about
twenty miles below Shawneetown and twenty miles
above Golconda, or about eighty-five miles below
Evansville, Indiana, and fifty miles above Paducah,
Kentucky. It is about two and one-half miles below
Ford’s Ferry and a half mile above the village of Cave-in-Rock.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
Its position commands a long view up and
down the Ohio River. It has a large and dark tunnel-like
opening extending into a gray limestone bluff
which is partly hidden by shrubbery and small trees.
Whether one sees it while passing in a boat or approaching
it from the shore the view invariably stirs the
beholder. It has the appearance of a large arched
crypt, imbedded in solid rock. It is a “house” built by
Nature, and is as solid as Gibraltar. It is sphynx-like
in its silence, and bewilders those who enter.</p>

<p>The mouth is an arched opening, semi-elliptical in
form, about fifty-five feet wide at the base. The cavern
extends back horizontally one hundred and sixty feet
with an almost uniform width of forty feet. The walls
and roof, which change to more or less of an ellipse
near the mouth, again change near the center into a
semi-ellipse and retain that curvature to the end. The
ceiling is horizontal throughout its length, while the
floor, beginning about seventy-five feet from the entrance,
gradually inclines upward toward the rear, and
at the extreme end comes within a few feet of the
arched ceiling. At this end there is a hole large enough
to permit a man to climb out into a sinkhole in the
surface above. The upward incline of the floor in the
rear is due to a deposit of earth, washed there during
the past half-century by water coming down through
the sinkhole during heavy rains. Near the middle of
the ceiling are two perpendicular crevices with an average
width of less than a foot, extending across and
beyond the Cave, and upward to within about fifteen
feet of the surface of the cliff. One of these narrow
crevices has, near the center, a chimney-like opening
sufficiently large to admit a man. It leads to a rough-walled
enlargement about four feet wide and ten feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
high. This small place is known as the “upper cave,”
and has a history and fiction of its own.</p>

<p>In the lower part of what may be designated the
lower lip of the mouth-like opening is a large, level,
wedge-shaped space about five feet lower than the floor
of the Cave. At its outer extremity this wedge-shaped
space is almost as wide as the mouth itself, but rapidly
tapers inward to a width of about four feet. It then
continues back into the mouth about twenty-five feet
through the solid rock, in the form of an excavated
channel or passage about three and one-half feet wide.
This narrow channel, about five feet deep at the beginning,
inclines upward until it reaches the general level
of the floor of the Cave. The top of the rock on either
side of the excavation is level and resembles a platform.
These two platforms or stage-like floors extend inward
and, like the inclined passage, soon reach the general
level of the Cave. This excavated channel and the part
of the wedge-shaped space from which it leads may
have been made by men, but whether by Indians or
early whites is not known. It may possibly be the
result of erosion.</p>

<p>At a normal stage of the river the mouth of the Cave
is, measured in the perpendicular, about half-way between
the top of the bluff and the water’s edge. In
spring the river frequently comes up to within a few
feet of the opening. When the water is extremely high
it enters; during great floods there is ample depth to
row a skiff the entire length of the Cave.</p>

<p>Such is Cave-in-Rock today, and such it was in pioneer
times, except that in the rear a deposit of earth had
not been washed in, and that large trees, which stood in
front of the mouth and hid or partly concealed it, have
long since disappeared. It was an ideal lair for river<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
outlaws; it furnished shelter and gave them every
advantage over passing travelers.</p>

<p>In March, 1766, John Jennings, a Philadelphia merchant,
going down the Ohio with a cargo of goods for
Fort de Chartres, Illinois, notes in his <cite>Journal</cite> that he
stopped for an hour near “a large rock with a cave in
it,” some twenty-five miles below the mouth of the
Wabash River. The earliest record of a homeseeking
pioneer who came to the Cave-in-Rock country and
there began an overland trip into Illinois dates back to
about 1780, when Captain Nathaniel Hull, of Massachusetts,
appeared at what later became Ford’s Ferry.
“He and several other young men,” writes Governor
John Reynolds in his <cite>Pioneer History of Illinois</cite>,
“descended the Ohio to a point near Ford’s Ferry on
that river [for a while known as Hull’s Landing and
later as Robin’s Ferry] and came across by land to Kaskaskia....
At this day the Indians were not hostile as
afterwards, so that Hull and party escaped through the
wilderness without injury.” Nor had any white man as
yet practiced piracy on the lower Ohio.</p>

<p>Victor Collot, a French engineer, is one of the first
writers who stopped at the Cave and published a brief
description of it. He knew of its existence long before
he arrived, for his book, <cite>A Journey in America</cite>, shows
that he had planned to stop at the “Big Cave,” and did
so in the summer of 1796 when he went down the river
to New Orleans.</p>

<p>A few months later the place was visited by Andrew
Ellicott, then on his way to Natchez for the purpose of
determining the boundary line between the United
States and Spain. An entry in his <cite>Journal</cite>, dated December
15, 1796, shows he “dined at the Great Cave
... one of the greatest natural curiosities on the
river.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
On April 16, 1797, Francis Baily, the English astronomer,
stopped there. His <cite>Journal of a Tour in the
Unsettled Parts of North America</cite> contains a few pages
on the “Big Cave.” Among other things he says, “its
entrance was on a landing-place. It had somewhat the
appearance of an immense oven. We entered it and
found the sides very damp.... We beheld a number
of names cut in the sides of the cave, which in this solitary
place, and cut off as we were from society, gave us
a degree of pleasure to look over.” Baily apparently
heard of no outlaws during his short stay. This probably
was due to the fact that his visit was made at a
time when the Cave was very damp, as is frequently the
case in spring. Had he appeared later, he might not
have survived to tell of his interesting travels in America,
for during the greater part of the year 1797 the
place was occupied by the notorious Mason family.</p>

<p>Perrin du Lac, in his <cite>Travels through the two Louisianas</cite>,
writes that he embarked at Pittsburgh, April
22, 1802, “in a pirogue thirty feet long and three feet
broad” and that a few weeks later he stopped at the
Cave. He says “it is considered one of the greatest
natural curiosities in North America.”</p>

<p>The first detailed description of Cave-in-Rock ever
printed, as far as now known, appeared in one of the
earliest editions of Zadok Cramer’s <cite>The Ohio and Mississippi
Navigator</cite> and was republished in the appendix
of <cite>Journal of a Tour</cite>, 1805, by Thaddeus M. Harris
without credit to Cramer.</p>

<p>Thomas Ashe, an unreliable English traveler, wrote
an account of Cave-in-Rock shortly after the Cramer
or the so-called Harris description was published, and
at a time when reports of some of the early robberies
that had been committed there were still in fresh circulation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
His book entitled <cite>Travels in America performed
in 1806</cite>, contains a chapter of fabrications
headed “Cave in the Rock, Ohio Bank, September,
1806.”</p>

<p>In July, 1807, Christian Schultz, then a young man,
started from Pittsburgh down the Ohio in a flatboat.
He arrived at “The Cave in the Rock” about October
1, continued his trip to New Orleans, and returned, via
ship, to New York. In his <cite>Travels on an Inland Voyage,</cite>
he devotes a few pages to the Cave, saying, among
other things:</p>

<p>“It is a very curious cavern.... I could not help
observing what a very convenient situation this would
be for a hermit, or for a convent of monks.... I have
no doubt that it has been the dwelling of some person
or persons, as the marks of smoke and likewise some
wooden hooks affixed to the walls sufficiently prove.
Formerly, perhaps, it was inhabited by Indians; but
since, with more probability, by a gang of that banditti,
headed by Mason and others, who, a few years ago,
infested this part of the country and committed a great
number of robberies and murders....”</p>

<p>Fortesque Cuming, an unprejudiced Englishman,
wrote in his <cite>Tour to the Western Country</cite> that the Cave
is “one of the finest grottoes or caverns I have ever
seen.” This interesting traveler, in January, 1807, proceeded
to Maysville, Kentucky, by boat, and from there
made horseback trips to central Kentucky and Ohio.
Returning to Pittsburgh, he started, on May 7, down
the Ohio in a flatboat for New Orleans. From old
Bruinsburg, a few miles above Natchez, he visited old
Greenville. In this town about three years before, one
of the Cave-in-Rock outlaws had been convicted under
unusual circumstances and hanged and buried in an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
unusual manner. When traveling by boat Cuming always
carried a few skiffs in order to get ashore more
easily. On May 18, 1807, a few minutes after passing
the head of Cave-in-Rock Island, he landed at what is
known as Cave Spring, a cave-like opening a few hundred
yards above Cave-in-Rock from which a strong
spring of water constantly flows. This crevice in Cave-in-Rock
bluff is about nine feet high, three feet wide,
and extends back some forty feet. Cuming at first mistook
it for the famous Cave, as has been done by more
than one traveler since his day. In his sketch pertaining
to his visit to Cave-in-Rock he writes:</p>

<p>“Rowing along shore [below Cave Spring] with the
skiff, we were soon undeceived as to that’s being the
Rocking Cave, as a third of a mile lower down, one of
the finest grottoes or caverns I have ever seen opened
suddenly to view, resembling the choir of a large
church as we looked directly into it. We landed immediately
under it and entered it. It is natural, but it
is evidently improved by art in the cutting of an entrance
three feet wide through the rock in the very center,
leaving a projection on each hand, excavated above to
the whole breadth of the cavern, the projections resembling
galleries.... It is crowned by large cedars,
and black and white oaks, some of which impend over,
and several beautiful shrubs and flowers, particularly
very rich columbines, are thickly scattered all around
the entrance.... Standing on the outside, the appearance
of some of the company at the inner end of the
cave was truly picturesque, they being diminished on
the eye to half their size, and removed to three times
their real distance.</p>

<p>“There is a perpendicular rocky bluff just opposite
the lower end of Cave Island, about two hundred yards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
above the Cave, where the river narrows to less than
half a mile wide, forming a fine situation for fortification.”</p>

<p>Thomas Nuttall probably was the last distinguished
traveler who came down the Ohio in a flatboat and
commented on the Cave. In his <cite>Journal of Travels
into the Arkansa Territory</cite> he states that he and his
party left Shawneetown December 14, 1818. After
floating a short distance they came up with three other
flatboats and, lashing them together, proceeded upon
an all-night journey. He further comments: “The
river is here very wide and magnificent and chequered
with many islands. The banks of Battery Rock, Rock-in-Cave,
and other places are bold and rocky with
bordering cliffs. The Occidental wilderness appears
to here retain its primeval solitude; its gloomy forests
are yet unbroken by the hand of man; they are only
penetrated by the wandering hunter and the roaming
savage.”</p>

<p>The early western travelers already cited, and a number
of their contemporaries and followers who saw the
Cave, published descriptions or references that agree in
the main, but each, in his own way, was evidently more
impressed by certain of its various features than were
some of the others who visited the place. A few speculated
upon it as an Indian temple of prehistoric times.
Some commented upon it from a geological standpoint.
A number were especially interested in the names they
found carved on the walls; some in the trees that grew
around the opening. Others dwelt upon it as a rendezvous
of outlaws.</p>

<p>For what various purposes the Cave may have been
used in prehistoric times by Mound-builders and Indians,
or even Cave Dwellers, is a question for archaeologists<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
and ethnologists. There is far less physical
evidence to indicate a previous presence of robbers and
counterfeiters than there is to prove that the place was
inhabited by prehistoric man. A rusty home-made
dagger blade and a part of a counterfeiter’s mold are
the only relics that point toward the outlaw occupancy.
On the other hand, five well-defined mound sites in the
level fields above Cave-in-Rock bluff, and the many
flint and stone implements picked up during the past
century in and near the Cave indicate beyond doubt
the former presence of Indians and Mound-builders.
In April, 1918, Robert L. Yeakey, while spading his
garden on this bluff, unearthed a carved stone image,
six inches high and four inches wide, weighing two
pounds, six ounces, representing a man in squatting
position. The probability that the image is an idol
gives strength to the inference that the Cave was used
as a temple some time in the prehistoric past.</p>

<p>The mounds are additional evidence to this effect.
These were opened many years ago and have since been
plowed over often. Each contained, it is said, from
five to ten human skeletons. The bodies had been
placed in a stone-walled sepulcher that was covered
with flags of stone a few inches thick, over which a circular
mound of earth was thrown. The fact that each
of these mounds contained a number of skeletons, apparently
placed there at one time, leads many to the
conclusion that a battle, or battles, must have been
fought in or near the Cave and that all, or some, of the
dead were buried together. Scientists advance a plausible
explanation of this: “We know not if these burials
indicate famine, pestilence, war, or unholy sacrifice.
We can only conjecture that they were not graves of
persons who had died a natural death.” Because of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
the Cave’s temple-like form and its proximity to these
old mounds, it appears more probable that they were
erected in connection with the ceremony of “unholy
sacrifice” than for any of the three other suggested
causes.</p>

<p>The Harris description of the Cave, written about
1803, refers to it as “the habitation of the Great Spirit.”
Some thirty years later, Edmund Flagg, in <cite>The Far
West</cite>, written after his visit to “Rock-Inn-Cave,” says:
“Like all other curiosities of Nature, this cavern was,
by the Indian tribes, deemed the residence of a Manito,
or spirit, evil or propitious, concerning whom many a
wild legend yet lives among their simple-hearted posterity.
They never pass the dwelling place of the
divinity without discharging their guns (an ordinary
mark of respect) or making some other offering propitiatory
of his favor.”</p>

<p>From official records we learn that the section of the
country in which Cave-in-Rock is embraced was sold,
in 1803, to the United States by the Kaskaskia tribe.
In 1818, when the sale was confirmed by the same Indians
and the three other tribes then constituting the Illinois
confederacy, it became unchallenged government
property. Thus, when the Masons, the Harpes, and
other early outlaws held forth there, it was still in the
Indians’ territory.</p>

<p>From a geological standpoint, the Cave is evidently
nothing more than a prosaic hole in a limestone bluff.
In neither the main cave nor the crevices above are
there any stalactites or stalagmites, but an incrustation
resembling such a formation occurs here and there on
the walls. In 1818, Henry R. Schoolcraft, in his <cite>Personal
Memoirs</cite>, says: “The cave itself is a striking object
for its large and yawning mouth, but to the geologist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
presents nothing novel.” Collot, in 1796, expressed
the opinion that “it is an excavation made in the
rocks by the continual beating of the flood.” In a <cite>Report</cite>
published in 1866, A. H. Worthen, director of the
Geological Survey of Illinois, states that “the limestone
(St. Louis limestone) is quite cherty and the Cave has
probably been formed by the action of water percolating
through crevices of the rock and by the eroding
influences of the atmosphere.” Neither of these explanations
is satisfactory. No other has been found.
Cave-in-Rock has the appearance of a section of a large
cave that was formed by an underground stream in
some remote geological age, and later disconnected, by
upheavals, from the other parts of the subterranean
passage. Some of the other parts may still exist. Sulphur
Springs Cave, four miles southwest of Equality,
may be one. Bigsby Cave, eight miles north of Cave-in-Rock,
may be another. Hardin County is besprinkled
with many sinkholes, the outlets of which are
unknown. The “Big Sink,” four miles north of the
Cave, covers about one hundred acres. Cave-in-Rock
may have been an outlet for some of these sinkholes
until upheavals made such drainage impossible.</p>

<p>In early days the virgin forests retarded, to a great
extent, the water of the heavy rains, and as a result
floods were less frequent and less severe. It is probable
that when Cave-in-Rock and the country about were
covered with trees the place was damper than now, for
the water then slowly seeped down from the tree-covered
surface. Nevertheless, it was sufficiently dry to
serve as a good shelter not only for outlaws, who frequently
occupied it, but also for men and women going
down the river in flatboats.</p>

<p>Today it is comparatively dry, except during the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
spring and shortly after a heavy rain. Practically all
the water running through the Cave now comes from a
narrow crevice in the rear, which drains a small sinkhole
in the surface. Through this opening, as already
stated, much soil has been deposited in the back part of
the Cave during the past fifty years. Nature has made
practically no changes in the Cave itself since its discovery
by white men, but the landscape has been affected
by the removal of the large trees that once
shaded its mouth. A decrepit sycamore, an ash or two,
a few small maple trees, some scrub cedars, and some
Virginia creeper constitute the only vegetation now
growing around the opening.</p>

<p>The travelers who visited Cave-in-Rock in flatboat
days gave the place more time and thought than did
those who appeared after the introduction of steamboats.
The New Orleans, or Orleans, which was
the first steam-propelled boat to make a trip from
Pittsburgh to New Orleans, passed it in 1811. Not
until fully five years thereafter was the practicability of
navigating the Ohio by steamboats satisfactorily demonstrated.
Local tradition has it that the James
Monroe, coming down in 1816, was the first steamboat
to land at the Cave. Thomas Nuttall, who appeared
on the scene two years later, was, as already stated, one
of the last distinguished men who floated down the
river in a flatboat and commented on the place. Leisure
was an inseparable feature of flatboat travel. With
the coming of steamboats the lingering of travelers
along the river became a thing of the past. After 1820
comparatively few boats of any kind stopped at the
Cave. Boats became more numerous, but whether propelled
by steam or oars, they traveled not only faster
but through a country rapidly increasing in population,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
and passengers and crew stopping in this section found
better shelter elsewhere. But Cave-in-Rock was ever
pointed out as a place that “in days gone by” had been
the den of flatboat robbers. Counterfeiters and other
outlaws, however, operated in the neighborhood until
as late as 1832.</p>

<p>The earliest record of a professional artist making a
sketch of the Cave dates back to May, 1819, when Major
Stephen H. Long came down the Ohio on the
steamer Western Engineer, on his way to his Rocky
Mountains exploring expedition. In his notes on
“Cave-Inn-Rock or House of Nature” he gives a
description of the Cave, and says that Samuel Seymour,
the official artist of the expedition, “sketched two views
of the entrance.” Edwin James’s account of this expedition
contains many of Seymour’s pictures, but none of
places east of the Mississippi. Efforts made in Washington
to locate his original sketches were without success.</p>

<p>Edmund Flagg, a traveler, journalist, and poet, who
lived the greater part of his life in Louisville and St.
Louis, spent a short time at the Cave in 1836, while on
a steamboat trip gathering material for his book, <cite>The
Far West</cite>. He gives some of the history of the outlaws
of “Cave-Inn-Rock” and then describes the Cave and
the Island. He says the place furnishes “a scene of
natural beauty worthy an Inman’s pencil” and that “if
I mistake not an engraving of the spot has been published:
a ferocious-looking personage, pistol in hand,
crouched at the entrance, eagerly watching a descending
boat.”</p>

<p class="smaller">(From the original drawing by Charles Alexander Lesueur)</p></div></div>

<p>Maximilian, Prince of Wied-Neuwied, writes May
19, 1833: “We embarked on the Paragon steamboat at
Shawneetown ... and after passing Cave-in-Rock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
Island, a long wooded island, we glided past Cave-in-Rock,
a cavern which has been drawn by Lesueur.”
Lesueur’s drawing was made about 1825. It is an interior
view looking out over the river and conveys a
good idea of the Cave’s size and form. However, the
opening to the small upper cavity and the leaning pole
for climbing into it are placed a little too far to the
left.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>Maximilian was accompanied by his artist, Charles
Bodmer, who, during the course of his travels in North
America, made eighty-one pictures, all of which were
published in 1843 in the <cite>Maximilian Atlas</cite>. Most of
these drawings pertain to the life of the Indians of the
Upper Missouri, and stand today as the first and best
record of the costumes of these tribes. Among the subjects
presented is his Cave-in-Rock picture, one of the
two early views of the Cave now available. Bodmer
probably drew it from memory. It shows a landscape
interesting in itself, but it is an absolutely misleading
presentation of the actual scene. From no point or
angle does the view appear as drawn by him, or even
suggest such a scene. By the ordinary working of
nature no such changes could have been brought about
in many centuries. The mouth of the Cave is near the
lower end of a long bluff of almost uniform height and
opposite the lower end of Cave-in-Rock Island. A
camera picture of the lower end of this bluff, made in
1917, appears among the illustrations in this book.
Bodmer’s view places the opening in a short bluff that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
is more or less cone-shaped and opposite or above the
head of an island. When high water reaches the mouth
of the Cave, as is shown by Bodmer, then Cave-in-Rock
Island is submerged many feet and its banks cannot
possibly be seen. This picture occurs in a number of
books, but without any comments on its gross inaccuracy.
Some reproducers have taken the liberty of adding
a setting sun in the background.</p>

<p>In 1916, J. Bernhard Alberts, of Louisville, made an
impressionistic painting of the mouth of the Cave. His
painting is true to the scene as it was at the time of his
visit. He also drew a pencil sketch showing a general
view of the interior with the inner edge of the mouth
in the immediate foreground, the artist’s point of view
being from just outside the mouth.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_3">Piracy and Rough Life on the River</h2>
</div>

<p>It is not clear when Cave-in-Rock first became the
headquarters of the criminals who flourished on the
Ohio, and preyed upon primitive commerce and travel
between Pittsburgh and the Lower Mississippi. Shortly
after the Revolution was under way, renegades from
eastern communities, corrupt stragglers from the
American army, and villains who had had their brutal
training in western wilds, began to seek in the Ohio
valley refuge from the more orderly and well settled
communities. Samuel Mason, who had been an officer
in the Continental army, converted the cavern into an
inn as early as 1797. While he occupied the Cave, and
a few years thereafter, it was known as “Cave-Inn-Rock.”
It was ideally located. Every passing boat
must reveal itself to those in the Cave who had a long,
clear view up and down the river. A lookout could
detect boats long before boatmen could perceive the
Cave. The bold beauty of the bluff made it pleasant
for the boats to run in near the sharply shelving shore,
and many travelers were thus simply and easily delivered
into the hands of the banditti. As an inn, where
drink and rest could be had, it decoyed them; as a scene
for shrouded crime it was perfect.</p>

<p>The earliest travelers on the western rivers floated
or propelled themselves with paddles and oars in small,
clumsy craft. The Indian canoe or pirogue was heavy,
but was managed with skill by those accustomed to its
use. With the growing stream of settlers and the increasing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
number of settlements along the Ohio and
Mississippi, there arose a necessity for larger craft that
would bear heavier burdens. This brought the flatboat
era covering the period from 1795 to 1820—that quarter
of a century known as the Golden Age of Flatboating.
During that era river piracy was at its height. The
lighter boats, pirogues, skiffs, and batteaux were to the
clumsy rafts and flatboats bearing heavy cargoes what
submarines and torpedo boats have been to the heavier
ships in later warfare. Inland piracy had its advantage
in using the small craft on dark nights for sudden
descents and escapes.</p>

<p>In the midst of this period the stately steamboat age
began its development. It was inaugurated in 1811
when the first steam-propelled “water-walker” made
its laborious and astonishing way from Pittsburgh to
New Orleans. By 1820 steamboats had become a dependable
factor in traffic, and were, to river travel,
what the railroad train was later to become to the slow
stagecoach and freight wagon. It was inevitable that
under steamboat influence flatboats of all types—arks,
broadhorns, Orleans boats, keel-boats, and flat-bottomed
barges—would follow the primitive pirogues, skiffs,
and batteaux into retirement, except for neighborhood
use. River piracy waned with the conditions it preyed
upon, but not until about 1830 did it cease utterly.</p>

<p>In society, as in nature, everything develops with
opportunity and disappears according to necessity. In
the primitive age of river craft many travelers were
captured or killed by Indians bent on revenge or pillage.
These marauders were sometimes led by white
renegades. Later, pioneers floating down the Ohio or
Mississippi on flatboats came in contact with comparatively
few savages, but were exposed to a far more daring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
and dangerous enemy in the form of river pirates—white
men, many of them descendants of supposedly
civilized European families. These disappeared as
the population increased. Then ensued the reign of
the more diplomatic river pirates—the professional
gamblers who, for a half century, used cards and other
gaming devices as instruments with which to rob those
who ventured into their society.</p>

<p>Such were the types of craft and men operating upon
and infesting the rivers in the early days. The country
through which these boats moved was not the country
we see today. Changes in the shapes and channels of
the rivers have been numerous, only the rock-defined
reaches preserving their original contours. Appearances
in detail have greatly changed. The wonderful
unbroken forests are gone. Where they once stood are
now fields and farms or cut-over forests; every few
miles there is a town. The river channels once mysterious
and uncertain are now carefully charted.</p>

<p>Early voyageurs going down the river had, of course,
no guides and there were no known marks to indicate
their approach to any of the features of the river as it
wound through the wild, uninhabited country. The
boatmen who came afterwards carrying maps rudely
scratched, found them unsatisfactory because of inaccuracies
or lack of detail. Not until a handbook was
made available, after some years of careful compilation
of river features, could the uninitiated navigate the
large rivers with any degree of safety.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>The numerous charts in <cite>The Navigator</cite> show the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
curves, islands, sandbars, eddies, and channels, and
mark the location of towns and many other places of
significance. The accompanying text contains instructions
of value to the boatman, and historical data of
interest. It is curious, however, that no section of either
the Mississippi or Ohio is designated as one where outlaws
were likely to be encountered—not even Cave-in-Rock
nor the mouth of Cache River, which were long
considered the most dangerous resorts on the Ohio. In
every edition of <cite>The Navigator</cite> about a page is devoted
to a description of the Cave and instructions to boatmen
passing it, but there is no reference to its grim history.
Zadok Cramer was evidently a practical man, with no
eye to the speculative. It was not until 1814 that he
added a few lines bearing on the Cave’s “economic”
history:</p>

<p>“This cavern sometimes serves as a temporary abode
for those wanting shelter, in case of shipwreck, or other
accident, which happen on the river near it. Families
have been known to reside here tolerably comfortable
from the northern blasts of winter. The mouth of this
cave was formerly sheltered, and nearly hid by some
trees growing in front of it, but the rude axe has leveled
them to the earth and the cavern is exposed to the open
view of the passenger. Emigrants from the states,
twenty-seven years ago used to land here and wagon
their goods across the Illinois country, it not being more
than one hundred and twenty miles from this place to
Kaskaskia on the Mississippi.”</p>

<p>The Cave, of course, had more than criminal uses.
How on one occasion it served as a “temporary abode
for those wanting shelter” is recorded in <cite>The American
Pioneer</cite>, published in 1842. In this magazine Dr.
Samuel P. Hildreth, under the title of “History of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
Voyage from Marietta to New Orleans in 1805,” gives
an interesting account of the schooner Nonpareil and
her voyage south, based on data furnished him by members
of her crew. The boat was built at Marietta and
started down the river April 21, 1805. She was a sea-going
vessel intended to run on the lakes near New
Orleans. The captain doubtless steered his course by a
copy of <cite>The Navigator</cite>. We quote from Hildreth’s
account of what the crew found in 1805 at the well-known
lair of outlaws:</p>

<p>“As the Nonpareil approached near the mouth of
this dreaded cave, a little after twilight, they were
startled at seeing the bright blaze of a fire at its entrance.
Knowing of its former fame as the den of a
band of robbers, they could not entirely suppress the
suspicion it awoke in their minds of its being again
occupied for the same purpose. Nevertheless, as they
had previously determined not to pass this noted spot
without making it a visit, they anchored the schooner
a little distance from the shore and landed in the skiff.
Being well armed with pistols they marched boldly up
to the cavern where, instead of being greeted with the
rough language and scowling visages of a band of robbers,
they found the cave occupied by smiling females
and sportive children. A part of the women were busily
occupied with their spinning wheels, while others prepared
the evening meal. Their suspicions were not,
however, fully removed by all these appearances of
domestic peace, still thinking that the men must be
secreted in some hidden corner of the cave ready to
fall on them unawares. On a little further conversation
they found the present occupants of the dreaded
cave consisted of four young emigrant families from
Kentucky going to settle in Illinois. The females were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
yet in the bloom of life. Their husbands had bought or
taken up lands a few miles back from the river, and
after moving their families and household goods to this
spot had returned to their former residences to bring
out their cattle, in the meantime leaving their wives and
children in the occupancy of the cave till their return.</p>

<p>“Having brought, with their spinning wheels and
looms, an abundance of flax, the women spent the
weary days of their husbands’ absence in the useful
employment of spinning. A large fire in the mouth of
the cave gave cheerfulness to the gloomy spot and
enabled them, at night, to proceed with their labors,
while its bright rays were reflected upon the looms,
beds, and household utensils which lay piled up along
the side of the cave. By day the sun afforded them
light, the mouth of the cave being capacious and elevated,
while the roof sheltered them from the rain.
They were in daily expectation of the arrival of their
husbands, when they would move out on to their farms
in company.</p>

<p>“A little conversation soon dissipated all suspicions
of harm from the minds of their visitors ... and, borrowing
from them a torch, they explored the hidden
recesses of the cave. At this time no vestige of its
former occupants remained but a few scattered barrel
staves, and the traces of their fires against the blackened
sides of the rock. The walls, even at that early day,
were thickly scored with the names of former visitors,
to which they hastily added their own, and thousands
have no doubt been added since. Bidding a warm farewell
to this singular and solitary community, they entered
their boat, greatly wondering at the courage and
confidence of these lonely females. Their surprise,
however, in a manner subsided when they reflected that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
they were the daughters of Kentucky and from the land
of Daniel Boone.”</p>

<p>The Nonpareil experienced no trouble with river
pirates, but was wrecked during a storm on the Mississippi
and never reached her proposed destination.
So, in one form or another, every flatboat and other
early river craft suffered more or less trouble. History
records many robberies and other misfortunes, but its
pages also show that, notwithstanding the numerous
trials and tribulations, early river life, rough as it was,
was more of a romance than a tragedy. Going down
the Ohio and Mississippi proved, in many instances,
“easy sailing” compared to the flatboatman’s overland
trip north over the Natchez Trace and other wilderness
roads infested with highwaymen.</p>

<p>The usual plan of the river robbers was to station one
or two of their men and women at some prominent
place on shore to hail a passing boat. These decoys
pleaded to be taken aboard, claiming they were alone
in the wilderness and wished to go to some settlement
further down the river, or that they desired to purchase
certain necessities which they lacked. If the boat was
thus enticed ashore, the crew saw their cargo unloaded,
and plundered, or beheld their craft continue its course
down the river in the hands of the enemy, themselves
held as hostages or murdered.</p>

<p>Boat wreckers were another common source of great
danger. Under one pretext or another they managed
to get aboard the boat and scuttle it near a place where
their confederates were prepared to make an attack.
Or, like Colonel Fluger, they waited until they found
a boat tied along the bank and then bored holes in the
bottom or dug out the caulking. When the ill-fated
boat began to sink, the fellow-wreckers rushed to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
rescue and appropriated the goods for their own use,
killing part or all the crew if necessary.</p>

<p>Then, as now, a number of dangerous channels existed
in the Ohio and Mississippi. They were designated
as such in <cite>The Navigator</cite>. Near the head of
some of them lived reliable settlers who made it a business
to pilot boats through for pay. Pirates frequently
succeeded in passing themselves off as trustworthy local
pilots. Boats turned over to such men for safe steering
were usually grounded and immediately thereafter delivered
into the hands of outlaws in waiting.</p>

<p>One of the dangerous channels, against which voyageurs
were warned by <cite>The Navigator</cite>, ran from the
head of Walker’s Bar (a bar beginning about two miles
below Cave-in-Rock) down to Tower Rock, and from
there extended to the foot of Hurricane Island, a total
distance of about eight miles. The author of the river
guide, after devoting considerable space to directions
for navigating this channel and avoiding the Hurricane
Bars, adds a suggestion: “Just below the Cave, on the
right bank, there is a person who is sometimes employed
to pilot boats through this serpentine channel,
and it is better for a stranger to pay a dollar or two for
this purpose, than run the risk of grounding on either
one or the other of these bars in low water. When the
water is high there is no occasion for a director.”</p>

<p>The outlaws at Cave-in-Rock turned to their advantage
the suggestion published in <cite>The Navigator</cite>.
About ten miles above the Cave, near Battery Rock, or
on what has long since been called the Jonathan Brown
Old Place, the robbers stationed a man who offered to
pilot, for a small sum, single boats or small fleets
through this “serpentine channel.” He explained that
the person referred to by <cite>The Navigator</cite> as living “just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
below the Cave” was out on a visit and would not
return for a week or more. In the event the first man
failed, another, standing ready a few miles further
down at Ford’s Ferry, offered his services. The pilot
who succeeded in being employed grounded the boat
in front of the Cave if, by the time he reached the
place, he judged the cargo was worth the risk and the
crew could be overpowered. If more time was
required, he guided the boat to the head of Hurricane
Island. There it was either wrecked or taken safely
through the channel, the procedure depending on
whether or not he judged a profitable robbery possible.
Boatmen who declined to take a pilot aboard at Battery
Rock or Ford’s Ferry were likely, if the water was
comparatively low, to inquire for a director “just below
the Cave.” The man procured there, whether a member
of the Cave band or not, invariably guided the
boat safely through. Thus by helping to maintain one
reputable and reliable place near the Cave for procuring
the services of a pilot, the robbers experienced
little trouble in trapping the boats they selected for
that purpose.</p>

<p>Although most of the prospective victims were given
little consideration until after they had come within
ten or twenty miles of the Cave, in a number of instances
the river pirates began setting a trap for a boat
long before it arrived at Shawneetown.</p>

<p>The fact that the victims were piloted to the Cave by
certain members of a band, or enticed into the place by
some other means for the sole purpose of robbery, is
recorded by many early writers; none of them, however,
gives any details. All authors who touch on the
Cave’s history publish statements based on what other
men and women heard other people had experienced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
while in the hands of the outlaws. Only one instance
has been found in which the victim himself (Dr.
Charles H. Webb) recited to an author the details of
how he was decoyed to the Cave and how he escaped
from the men then occupying the place. The old flatboat
robbers and flatboat wreckers left no first-hand
accounts of the methods they employed.</p>

<p>The year 1788 roughly marks the beginning of the
big inflow of settlers into the region west of the Alleghenies,
also the beginning of counterfeiting and other
outlawry at Cave-in-Rock. Many travelers and home-seekers
followed the trails and went into the interior
afoot, on horseback, or in wagons; others took the river
to some river point and either settled there, or proceeded
overland to an inland section. Thus, by “long
lines of wagons” and “great fleets of boats” the middle
West became settled. In the meantime many a small
party traveled alone over the trails or drifted down the
river in a single boat or in a small fleet, into the new and
sparsely populated country, and became easy prey for
highway robbers or river pirates who were likely to
appear at any time and in any disguise.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>The earliest connection of the Cave with the name of
any outlaw who became famous was in 1797, when
Samuel Mason, of Revolutionary fame and hideous
fate, seems to have occupied it as a main trap for his
carefully worked out scheme of river piracy on a large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
scale. He erected a great rude sign on the river bank
near the mouth of the Cave, proclaiming to every passerby
that his “Liquor Vault and House for Entertainment”
was open to the public. Many captains and their
crews and many flatboat passengers were lured to it.
After Mason and his family left for the South, most of
the succeeding bands, during their necessarily short
stay, operated a gambling and drinking place on the
same principle.</p>

<p>It was a common practice among outlaws frequently
to change not only their headquarters but their names.
While at Cave-in-Rock Mason was also known as
“Wilson.” Thomas Ashe, who wrote about it, probably
did not know that the Wilson he described was
Samuel Mason. Among the various men who appeared
after the departure of Samuel Mason, alias “Wilson,”
was one Jim Wilson. Whether Jim Wilson was his real
name is not known. However, between Samuel Mason
as “Wilson” and a later man known as “Jim Wilson”
there has been more or less confusion for almost a century,
especially in tradition. In 1897 William Courtney
Watts wrote a historical romance, <cite>Chronicles of a
Kentucky Settlement</cite>, in which he presents James Ford,
of Ford’s Ferry notoriety, as “James Wilson.” James
Ford was in no way connected with Mason or with
Wilson, but his presentation under the fictitious name
of “James Wilson” had added to the already existing
confusion.</p>

<p>After James Ford’s death, which occurred in 1833—and
many years before Watts applied the name of
“James Wilson” to him—a writer published a sketch
of the career of one Jim Wilson at the Cave. This
sketch is here recapitulated, not as a story that can be
verified in all its details by history, but as a semi-historical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
tale which may convey a better idea of the methods,
life, and fate of the Cave’s outlaws than formal history.
Only one who will make a study of the Cave’s past—from
the available authenticated records down to some
of its absurd traditions—will recognize this story as a
picture in which facts fairly divide the scene with fiction,
and painted in colors that bring joy to the hearts
of readers of dime novels. When and by whom it was
written or first published has not been ascertained. It
apparently was not written before 1836, for the author,
in his introduction, attempts a description of the Cave
as it appeared that year. The writer evidently had read
Thomas Ashe’s account published in 1808, and was also
familiar with some of the Cave’s printed history and
oral traditions. The story was probably first published
in an old magazine or newspaper. In 1893 it appeared,
anonymously and without credit, in the <cite>Crittenden
Press</cite>, of Marion, Kentucky. From that weekly it was
copied by many newspapers in the lower Ohio Valley,
and is now preserved, under various titles, in many a
scrap book.</p>

<p>This old story is interesting because it was written
when stories of the Cave were still fresh. Inaccuracies
and confusions of names and dates may have crept in,
but it remains the first concise and inherently reasonable
account of how the Cave was first occupied as a
den by river criminals. In the presentation of the
usual method of the Cave’s renegades, it matters very
little whether the first of those desperate captains of
crime bore the name of Wilson, Mason, or Harpe. In
this case it seems clearly the story of Samuel Mason
about 1797. The names they assumed might vary with
every flatboat or raft that passed. An alias is ever the
shield of the criminal. The story describes not only a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
method actually employed by the Cave’s outlaws for
many years, but also a method by which the career of
more than one of these river pirates was, as we shall see
later, so tragically terminated. The story runs, as
follows:</p>

<p>“About the year 1809, one Jim Wilson, a flatboatman,
while passing down the Ohio, was overtaken by a terrific
storm. He steered his boat under the shelter of a
cliff. On landing he observed the opening of the cave.
He was attracted by the commodious rooms with dry
ceilings and sanded floors, and resolved that on his
return to Pittsburgh he would bring his family hither.</p>

<p>“In the following spring Wilson’s boat again landed
at the foot of the cliff. This time he was not alone, but
with him came his wife, five children, two slaves, and
William Hall, the great counterfeiter. His boat was
loaded with provisions, stores, liquors, and arms, which
he had stolen from the government warehouse at Fort
Pitt on the night before his departure. The great cave
was soon transformed into a dwelling and tavern large
enough to accommodate several travelers.</p>

<p>“Wilson’s object for landing and establishing himself
in so remote and romantic headquarters will be seen
hereafter. A sign was planted at the water’s edge bearing
these words: ‘Wilson’s Liquor Vault and House for
Entertainment.’ This novel sign had a magnetic effect
upon the boatmen who were almost daily passing en
route to southern markets, with flatboats loaded with
produce. The boat crews were generally jovial fellows,
fond of rum, rest, and merriment, and hardly a
boat passed without stopping. Many were the guests
at Wilson’s Tavern; thieves and gamblers stopped off
here and in a few months the place became infamous
for its licentiousness and blasphemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
“Wilson had been for many years a deep-dyed criminal
and only came here that he might vary his crimes,
and have a wider field for operation. Out of his guests
he soon formed a band of the most noted robbers, murderers,
and counterfeiters that, for two years, had no
parallel in modern history. Their headquarters were
at the Cave, but they had many stations along the Ohio
above and below, which were maintained for the purpose
of preventing suspicion being cast upon the genial
landlord at the Cave. The principal station was at
Hurricane Island, where forty-five men were stationed
all the time.</p>

<p>“Each boat that landed at the Cave was captured and
such of the crew as would not join Wilson’s Gang
were allowed to drift on to Hurricane Island where
they were again captured and the remainder of the
crew foully murdered and their bodies cast into the
Ohio. With new pilots and crews the boats and cargoes
were taken to New Orleans, and converted into cash
which was conveyed to the Cave through the wilderness
of Kentucky and Tennessee.</p>

<p>“Many boats loaded with valuable cargoes left port
on the upper Ohio and its tributaries, under the guidance
of experienced and trustworthy officers. The officers
and crews never returned. No returns for sales
were ever received. It soon became a mystery that so
many honorable men never came back to pay over the
proceeds, and to tell the perils of their voyage. It was
many months before any serious suspicions were created.
After that it was found that the cargoes were
disposed of by entirely different crews from those entrusted
with them. There was but limited postal or
other communication in those days—letters of special
importance were carried by messengers who often fell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
into the hands of Wilson’s men. Thereby they kept
posted and, by changing the communication to suit their
purposes, and forwarding them by different carriers,
often thwarted the attempt of justice, and kept their
whereabouts enveloped in mystery for many months.
‘But it is a long lane that hath no turn.’ It was finally
ascertained that no tidings could be had of any boat
after it had passed certain points on the Ohio near
Wilson’s Tavern.</p>

<p>“A meeting of the Pittsburgh shippers was called
and it was determined to ferret out the mystery. This
would be a shrewd piece of detective work which
would be attended by many dangers. A large reward
was offered for information as to the exact location of
the robber band. John Waller, a determined and ambitious
man of Maysville, Kentucky, resolved to secure
the reward or perish in the attempt. He was furnished
with a cargo contributed by various shippers along the
Ohio, and with five trusted companions he set out early
in the spring of 1810. They floated with the current
many days. At last one evening they came in sight of
the Cave, and were attracted by the novel sign and also
the presence of several females on the bank, who made
gestures for them to land. They held a hasty consultation
and resolved to land; a few sweeps of the steering
oar brought them to the foot of the cliff.”</p>

<p>That which follows this clear description of ordinary
circumstances is evidently a mixture of fact and fiction
that represents the imaginative style of the day. It is
quite plain that the author himself had not personally
visited the Cave, but had relied upon the fictions of
Thomas Ashe or the reflections from Ashe’s account
that had gained circulation and belief. He accepts the
mythical “upper cave” and has the Cave divided off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
into rooms and a “council chamber,” no relics of which
have ever been reported by any matter-of-fact observer
from that time to this. The leader, “Jim Wilson,” he
converts into a semi-savage with matted and tangled
hair and beard, who is yet a shrewd trader and an
orator of no mean power for his day. On the occasion
of the initiation of new recruits Jim Wilson delivers a
romantic and argumentative speech that is equal to the
best fiction of the times.</p>

<p>The story narrates graphically how Waller and his
men were overawed and compelled, under fear, to
agree to join the robber band; how they were received
into it with melodramatic ceremonies and then were
oath-bound, but not fully trusted; how they made their
escape—the savage and astute robbers being, of course,
fooled for the exigencies of the event; how the Waller
force combined with its waiting reinforcements, returned,
captured Jim Wilson and then went to Hurricane
Island and destroyed that part of the band; and
how eventually “Jim Wilson’s head was severed, his
body buried ... the head identified and delivered
to the proper authorities at Pittsburgh ... and the
captors received the merited reward.” This last point
is plainly an echo of Mason’s fate.</p>

<p>This story of the activities of the early renegades of
civilization, and of the river pirates who occupied the
Cave bears upon its face the stamp of truth that fits
neatly into practically all traditions from about 1795
to about 1820.</p>

<p>Before Mason became famous, however, greater
scoundrels than he were to attract public attention, and
hold it for some years. The story of the Harpes—“Big”
and “Little” Harpe—is one that may freeze the
blood as read now in the light of old records and personal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
accounts that seem to bring the reader into the
very presence of these two brutes. In the security of
law and order in these days the facts seem remote, but
when the sparse settlement of the West in 1799 is realized,
and the further fact that wilderness hospitality
opened doors to all travelers and admitted these monsters
freely with good people, it is possible then to conceive
the horror their deeds and presence aroused.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_4">The Harpes—A Terrible Frontier Story</h2>
</div>

<p>The career of the two Harpes<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> in Tennessee, southern
Illinois, and Kentucky, particularly Kentucky, at the
close of the eighteenth century has rarely been equalled
in the history of crime, either in peace or war. Its
beginning was so sudden, its motives wrapped in such
mystery, its race so swift, and its circumstances so terrible
and unbelievably brutal as to justify Collins, the
distinguished historian of Kentucky, in referring to the
brothers as “the most brutal monsters of the human
race.”</p>

<p>At that time, 1798–99, Kentucky had a pioneer population
of about two hundred thousand, which was
largely centered in the new trading and agricultural
towns in the eastern part and in the rich bluegrass
country. The remainder of the state, except along the
water courses, was well nigh a wilderness. In the
southern and western portions buffalo grazed, and bear
were plentiful. East Tennessee, where the scourge of
crime began, was even more sparsely settled. This
pioneer population was vigorous, rude, and accustomed
even to Indian atrocities. Among the settlers were
many who, as fugitives from justice, had deliberately
sought seclusion from the eastern states because of criminal
offenses. The Ohio River was infested with inland
pirates, and the early rivermen themselves were a rough
and violent type. Isolation led well-meaning pioneers
to be generous and confiding to those whom they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
tested, but to a great degree might was right, and
strangers looked askance at each other and were prepared
for the worst.</p>

<p>Yet such a rude and hardy people as these were
gripped with horror at the atrocities of the Harpes, at
their often unmeaning and unprovoked murders. It
is difficult in these days of well ordered government to
realize the mysterious terror and excitement that began
near Knoxville in 1798 and swept through the wilderness
to the borders of the Mississippi, and across the
Ohio into Illinois like some sudden, creeping fire that
breaks out in underbrush, and grows steadily in intensity
and rage until it sweeps forests before it. All this
was, in a measure, realized in the breasts of human beings
as the hideous crimes of the Harpes increased.</p>

<p>Aside from the wars and the recorded importances
of political development, the episode of the Harpes is
the most astounding event in the early life of the
Middle West. It engaged the memory of men for forty
years, and the pens of numerous historians, and writers
of memoir have been occupied with it ever since. In
the main the story has been well preserved, but in the
details there has been the variation that grows with
repetition. The most dignified historians have not disdained
to seek the minute details attaching to the persons
and actions of these two men from the moment
they began their criminal career to the thrilling blood-chase
in which the older brother was captured and
killed, and the younger escaped into exile and to an
even more dramatic and terrible death.</p>

<p>To this day the story of “The Harpes” and “Harpe’s
Head” is told about firesides in the Cave-in-Rock country,
in southern and western Kentucky and in eastern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
Tennessee. It has been perpetuated in folk ballads and
written by scores of pens. [<a href="#B93">93</a>]</p>

<p>It is the purpose here to bring together the many
threads of the tale as they have been verified and corrected
by original records sought from Wisconsin to
New Orleans, and from Knoxville to Cave-in-Rock
and the Mississippi River.</p>

<p>Judge James Hall, while living in Illinois, wrote a
brief account of one of the crimes committed by these
outlaws, and in April, 1824, published it in <cite>The Port
Folio</cite> of Philadelphia. In his introductory remarks he
comments: “Neither avarice nor want nor any of the
usual inducements to the commission of crime, seemed
to govern their conduct. A savage thirst for blood—a
deep-rooted enmity against human nature, could alone
be discovered in their actions.... Plunder was not
their object; they took only what would have been
freely given them, and no more than what was necessary
to supply the immediate wants of nature; they destroyed
without having suffered injury, and without the prospect
of benefit.... Mounted on fine horses they
plunged into the forest, eluded pursuit by frequently
changing their course, and appeared unexpectedly to
perpetrate new horrors, at points distant from those
where they were supposed to lurk.”</p>

<p>Judge Hall, up to that time, had done little more than
describe one of their last crimes, yet <cite>The Cincinnati
Literary Gazette</cite>, May 28, 1825, came out with a statement
admitting that there may have been two outlaws
by the name of Harpe, but added: “We have no hesitation
in asserting that their history, as published in
<cite>The Port Folio</cite>, is unworthy of belief.... The horrible
details concerning these men ... such disgusting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
sketches of human depravity and barbarism manifest
either a vitiated taste or a total disregard of the morals
of the community.”</p>

<p>As far as is now known, at least two papers published
in the month following came to the defense of Judge
Hall’s account. <cite>The Illinois Gazette</cite>, of Shawneetown,
among other things, declared: “The depravity and
bloodshed which marked their existence ... are circumstances
too strongly impressed upon the recollections
of our early settlers to be contradicted at this
date.”</p>

<p><cite>The Columbian</cite>, of Henderson, Kentucky, in a half
column article devoted to the same subject, asserts:
“The account published in <cite>The Port Folio</cite> is correct in
every essential point.... However it may be regretted
that such monsters as the Harpes ever should have existed
to disgrace humanity, yet it is an uncontrovertible
fact.” [<a href="#B56">56</a>]</p>

<p>In the August, 1825, issue of <cite>The Port Folio</cite> Judge
Hall published an account of another murder committed
by the Harpes—the killing of Thomas Langford,
who was among their first victims in Kentucky.
In the same number he devotes a few pages to a verification
of the statements he published then and a few
months previous. And before half had been told about
the Harpes, <cite>The Cincinnati Literary Gazette</cite> was convinced
of its error in doubting and disputing the veracity
of Judge Hall. Judge Hall wrote several pages
justifying the publication of the weird and wonderful
facts of the career of the Harpes. His arguments published
in 1825 in his own defense hold good today and
may be equally well applied to the story of the Harpes
here given, which, as far as is known, is the first attempt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
to compile a complete history of these notorious outlaws:</p>

<p>“If it is intended to be objected, that these ‘horrid
details,’ even if true, are not proper for publication—I
reply, that whatever tends to develop the history or
character of a people, is a legitimate subject of public
discussion. History to be of any value must be true. It
must disclose not only the truth but the whole truth.
In vain would the historian seek this in the frail monuments
vaguely preserved in the uncertain legend of tradition.
He must resort to national records and to the
testimony of writers contemporary with the events
which he attempts to describe, and if the latter abstain
from the narration of ‘disgusting sketches of human
depravity and barbarism,’ history must be curtailed of
her most fruitful source of incident, and men and nations
stripped of their boldest peculiarity. It is perhaps
forgotten that ‘depravity and barbarism’ constitute
almost the sole basis of history, tragedy, and the
epic song; that kings and courts are nothing without
them; that they revel amid ‘the pomp, pride, and circumstance
of glorious war;’ and stand forth in bold
relief in every department of civil subordination. It
is to be deplored that such is the fact; but while crime
and folly continue to predominate in the affairs of men,
they will be found to swell the pages of those who
attempt to exhibit correct pictures of human nature.</p>

<p>“In describing the American backwoodsmen, a class
of men peculiar to our country, I have thought it
proper to introduce among other authentic anecdotes
the story of the Harpes. My object was to display as
well the extraordinary sufferings to which the earliest
emigrants to the western country were exposed, as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
courage with which they met and repelled those hardships.”</p>

<p>The Harpes were believed to be brothers. They
were natives of North Carolina. Micajah, known as
Big Harpe, was born about 1768, and Wiley, known as
Little Harpe, was born about 1770. Their father was
said to have been a Tory who fought under the British
flag at King’s Mountain and took part in a number of
other battles against the colonists. Before the close of
the Revolution and immediately thereafter many of the
Tories living in the south Atlantic colonies fled toward
the Mississippi. Those who still sympathized with the
King of England and continued to live in the “Old
States” were, in most sections, ostracized by their neighbors.
It was to this class that the parents of the Harpes
belonged; and it was, therefore, in an environment of
hatred for and by neighbors that the two sons grew up.</p>

<p>About the year 1840 Colonel G. W. Sevier, son of
Governor John Sevier, in an interview with Lyman C.
Draper, the historian, stated that Big Harpe, when
asked shortly before he was killed why he had committed
so many crimes, answered that he had been badly
treated and consequently had become disgusted with all
mankind. [<a href="#B12G">12<span class="smcap smaller">G</span></a>] The same statement is made by J. W.
M. Breazeale, another well-known early Tennesseean,
who had lived in Knoxville the greater part of his life
and had investigated the careers of the outlaws.</p>

<p>One writer attributes their acts of fiendish inhumanity
to the fact that they believed every man’s life,
whether good, indifferent or bad, was predestined and
that the All Wise had foreordained for them a hatred
of humanity and a career of crime. [<a href="#B121">121</a>] Draper, in his
“Sketch of the Harpes,” comments on the fact that
“their tawny appearance and dark curly hair betrayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
a tinge of African blood coursing through their veins.”</p>

<p>Criminologists may or may not agree as to the underlying
cause of the great thirst for blood possessed by
the Harpes, but the fact that they were the most savage
and terrible characters in this period of American history
cannot be disputed.</p>

<p>About the year 1795 the two men, accompanied by
Susan Roberts and Betsey Roberts, left North Carolina
for Tennessee. Susan claimed to be the legal wife of
Big Harpe, whereas Betsey merely posed as such. Big
Harpe, however, claimed both women as his wives.
The Harpes cared as little for the laws of matrimony
as for any other laws and the legality or illegality of
anything they did was a matter of indifference to them.</p>

<p>The two men and their women roamed in central
Tennessee about two years. Most of their time was
spent with a few stray Creek and Cherokee Indians
who at the time were ostracized by their tribes and
were committing atrocities against their own people as
well as against the whites. The Harpes joined the
savages in their outrages, and not only encouraged them
in their bloody deeds, but gave them many demonstrations
showing to what extent barbarity could be practiced.
Asleep or awake they were armed with tomahawks
and knives and never took a step from camp
without a gun. They were always prepared to shed
blood for the satisfaction of shedding it, or to resist
arrest should any attempt be made to capture them.
They lived like man-eating animals. The women as
well as the men wore leather hunting shirts and moccasins
made from the untanned skin of animals they
killed. They never wore hats except in the coldest
weather and then used the kind they “whanged” together
with deer skin thongs. [<a href="#B121">121</a>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
Some time during 1797 the four left middle Tennessee
for the new settlement of Knoxville. While
wandering toward the eastern part of the state they
met a young Methodist preacher named William Lambuth,
who was traveling through the wilderness alone.
They robbed him and among his belongings found
a Bible. In turning the leaves, looking for bank
bills, Big Harpe discovered on the front page, written
in plain letters the names “William Lambuth” and
“George Washington.” Pointing to the name of the
General, Harpe remarked: “That is a brave and good
man, but a mighty rebel against the King.” The articles
found in Lambuth’s possession convinced the
Harpes that he was a preacher, whereupon they returned
to him not only his Bible but also the gun, the
little money, and the horse they had taken. Then
abruptly turning from him and shouting, “We are the
Harpes,” they quickly disappeared. This is probably
the only instance in the lives of the Harpes, after the
beginning of their murderous career, when they had
anyone, old or young, in their power, and showed less
than a fiendish barbarity. [<a href="#B121">121</a>]</p>

<p>Obeying the principle that birds of a feather flock
together, the Harpes, it seems, were attracted toward
the new settlement of Knoxville. In March, 1798,
James Weir, on his way from South Carolina to Kentucky,
spent a few days in the town. Writing of his
short stay there he says:</p>

<p>“In the infant town of Knox the houses are irregular
and interspersed. It was County Court day when I
came. The town was confused with a promiscuous
throng of every denomination. Some talked, some
sang, and mostly all did profanely swear. I stood
aghast, my soul shrank back to hear the horrid oaths<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
and dreadful indignities offered to the Supreme Governor
of the Universe, who with one frown is able to
shake them into non-existence. There was what I never
did see before, viz., on Sunday, dancing, singing, and
playing of cards, etc.... It was said by a gentleman
of the neighborhood that ‘the Devil is grown so old that
it renders him incapable of traveling and that he has
taken up in Knoxville and there hopes to spend the remaining
part of his days in tranquility, as he believes
he is among his friends,’ but as it is not a good principle
to criticise the conduct of others, I shall decline it with
this general reflection, that there are some men of good
principles in all places, but often more bad ones to
counterbalance them.” [<a href="#B109">109</a>]</p>

<p>The Harpes doubtless felt they could better gratify
their thirst for blood in the vicinity of a settlement like
Knoxville than in a wide wilderness where subjects for
their cruelty were too few. They found a small tract
of cleared land on Beaver Creek, about eight miles
west of Knoxville. Upon this they built a log cabin for
themselves, and a pen for their horses, and, in order to
conceal their motives, cultivated a few acres of ground.
Under this feint of honest occupation they experienced
no difficulty in gaining the confidence of their neighbors.
In fact, so easily had they made a favorable impression
that within a few weeks after their arrival
Little Harpe married Sarah or Sally Rice, a daughter
of John Rice, a preacher living about four miles north
of the Harpe hut.</p>

<p>In the meantime the two brothers made trips to the
seat of justice, for then, as now, the occasion and the
desire “to go to town” to see “what’s going on” was a
common one among the people who lived in the country.
Swapping horses was then, and still is to a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
extent, one of the features of a day at the small court
house towns. So when, on one of their first trips to
Knoxville, the Harpes brought with them a fine three-year-old
mare and offered to run her in a race, no suspicion
was aroused. The horse was apparently superior
to any other in town that day and no owner could be
induced to venture his quarter nag against her. A Mr.
Aycoff, recognizing the mare as an unusually good one,
bought her and became so attached to the animal that
he kept her almost a quarter of a century. It is interesting
to note that twenty years after he purchased her,
a gentleman from Georgia, visiting near Knoxville,
recognized her as the filly that had been stolen from
him many years before. [<a href="#B12G">12<span class="smcap smaller">G</span></a>]</p>

<p>The Harpes rapidly increased the number of their
trips to town, but it was soon noticed that with each succeeding
visit their supply of pork and mutton increased.
They sold this meat to John Miller, one of the most
respected merchants of Knoxville, through whom the
Harpe hams soon became well known. But the reputation
of the two brothers for drinking and gambling,
and the disturbances they raised in the village were
sufficient to arouse suspicion in the community. By
this and other evidence John Miller was convinced that
the Harpes were hog thieves, and suspected that their
dishonesty and meanness had no limit. [<a href="#B12G">12<span class="smcap smaller">G</span></a>]</p>

<p>Soon after the arrival of the Harpes in east Tennessee
a number of houses and stables near Knoxville were
set on fire and many of them burned to the ground. As
no motive for such destruction of property could be
discovered, the citizens attributed it to downright rascality.
So strong had become suspicion against the
Harpes that when Edward Tiel, who lived a mile from
Knoxville, discovered that several of his best horses had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
been stolen, he enlisted a number of neighbors and immediately
proceeded to the home of the Harpes. The
investigators found that the cabin had been deserted
recently, but noticed indications that horses had been
tied to some near-by trees. Tiel and his men took up
the trail and followed it across Clinch River into the
Cumberland Mountains. There they captured the two
Harpes who were alone at the time. The stolen horses
were recovered, but when the captors and their prisoners
reached a point about five miles northeast of Knoxville,
the horse thieves made their escape. [<a href="#B21">21</a>]</p>

<p>Tiel and his men tried to effect their recapture but,
failing in the attempt, returned to Knoxville. That
same night the two Harpes appeared at Hughes’
“rowdy groggery,” a few miles west of Knoxville,
where they had gone to exercise their brutality before
leaving Tennessee. Hughes, his wife’s two brothers,
named Metcalfe, and a man named Johnson, living in
Jefferson County, were present when the Harpes, who
knew the men, rushed in. Johnson was last seen alive
there. A few days later his body was discovered in the
Holstein River. It had been ripped open, filled with
stones, and thrown into the water. Notwithstanding
this excess of caution the stones became loosened and
the corpse rose to the surface. When the body was
discovered Hughes and the Metcalfes came forth with
a declaration that the Harpes had committed the crime.
Suspicion fell upon the accusers and as the two Harpes
were nowhere to be found, the three men were arrested
and put in jail. They were acquitted on trial, due to
lack of evidence. The Metcalfes immediately fled the
country. A party of “regulators” followed Hughes to
his groggery, gave him a whipping, pulled down his
house and drove him out of the country. [<a href="#B12G">12<span class="smcap smaller">G</span></a>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
The killing of Johnson, as far as is known, seems to
have been the first of the murders committed by the
Harpes. Up to this time they had apparently confined
their operations to stealing hogs and horses, and setting
fire to houses. They now began a career of ruthless
murder which was so bold that it not only terrified the
citizens of Tennessee and Kentucky, but also alarmed
settlers in many other sections of the Middle West.</p>

<p>The Harpes evidently had arranged to meet their
three women associates at some definite point if they
should for any reason find it necessary to separate.
Shortly after the killing of Johnson the five met in
western Virginia, near Cumberland Gap, and there, in
December, 1798, they entered Kentucky—the “dark and
bloody ground,” to be made even darker by the deeds
they were to commit during the next twelve months.</p>

<p>They traveled the Wilderness Road more or less
closely, leaving it only when they felt their safety demanded
a detour. Their first victim in Kentucky was a
peddler named Peyton, whom they encountered near
the Cumberland River in what is now Knox County.
They killed him and took his horse and some of his
goods, but the details of this deed are not known. [<a href="#B21">21</a>]</p>

<p>The outlaws continued along this trail toward Crab
Orchard and Stanford, in Lincoln County, and overtook
two Marylanders named Paca and Bates. Night
came on and it was proposed that the party camp on
the first suitable spot. This was agreed upon, but the
Harpes managed not to find a desirable place until it
grew dark. Suddenly, as if by accident, the brothers
changed positions, Big Harpe getting behind Bates and
Little Harpe behind Paca, the women walking about
thirty feet in the rear. The Harpes fired and the two
unfortunate Marylanders fell. Bates died instantly. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
few minutes later Paca, who was badly crippled and
knocked speechless, attempted to rise. Big Harpe
rushed up to the struggling man, “splitting open his
head with a hatchet or tomahawk he carried in his
belt.” The Harpes, being in need of some clothing,
appropriated only such garments as were immediately
useful. They took, however, all the gold and silver and
Continental coin found in possession of their victims.
[<a href="#B121">121</a>]</p>

<p>The villains continued along the Wilderness Road
and one night in December, 1798, arrived at a public
house kept by John Farris in what is now Rockcastle
County, not many miles from Crab Orchard. With
them came Stephen Langford, of Virginia, who was on
his way to Crab Orchard to visit a kinsman and to consider
making that locality his home. Langford probably
had not met the Harpes until that morning. The
story of what took place after they met was related
about a quarter of a century later by Judge James Hall,
who, in his day, ranked among the best living authors
in America, and whose statements were then, and have
been ever since, cited as high authority. His story of
their encounter with Langford was first published in
August, 1825, in <cite>The Port Folio</cite>. After making some
slight revisions in his “Story of the Harpes” he republished
the sketch in 1828 in his <cite>Letters from the West</cite>,
from which book his account of the Langford tragedy
is here quoted:</p>

<p>“In the autumn of the year 1799, a young gentleman,
named Langford, of a respectable family in Mecklenburgh
County, Virginia, set out from this state for Kentucky,
with the intention of passing through the Wilderness,
as it was then called, by the route generally
known as Boone’s Trace. On reaching the vicinity of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
the Wilderness, a mountainous and uninhabited tract,
which at that time separated the settled parts of Kentucky
from those of Virginia, he stopped to breakfast
at a public house near Big Rockcastle River. Travelers
of this description—any other indeed than hardy
wood men—were unwilling to pass singly through this
lonely region; and they generally waited on its confines
for others, and traveled through in parties. Mr. Langford,
either not dreading danger, or not choosing to delay,
determined to proceed alone. While breakfast was
preparing, the Harpes and their women came up. Their
appearance denoted poverty, with but little regard to
cleanliness; two very indifferent horses, with some bags
swung across them, and a rifle gun or two, comprised
nearly their whole equipage. Squalid and miserable,
they seemed objects of pity, rather than of fear, and
their ferocious glances were attributed more to hunger
than to guilty passion. They were entire strangers in
that neighborhood, and, like Mr. Langford, were about
to cross the Wilderness. When breakfast was served,
the landlord, as was customary at such places in those
times, invited all the persons who were assembled in
the common, perhaps the only room of his little inn, to
sit down; but the Harpes declined, alleging their want
of money as the reason. Langford, who was of a lively,
generous disposition, on hearing this, invited them to
partake of the meal at his expense; they accepted the
invitation, and ate voraciously. When they had thus
refreshed themselves, and were about to renew their
journey, Mr. Langford called for the bill, and in the
act of discharging it imprudently displayed a handful
of silver. They then set out together.</p>

<p>“A few days after, some men who were conducting
a drove of cattle to Virginia, by the same road which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
had been traveled by Mr. Langford and the Harpes,
had arrived within a few miles of Big Rockcastle
River, when their cattle took fright, and, quitting the
road, rushed down a hill into the woods. In collecting
them, the drovers discovered the dead body of a man
concealed behind a log, and covered with brush and
leaves. It was now evident that the cattle had been
alarmed by the smell of blood in the road, and, as the
body exhibited marks of violence, it was at once suspected
that a murder had been perpetrated but recently.
The corpse was taken to the same house where the
Harpes had breakfasted, and recognized to be that of
Mr. Langford, whose name was marked upon several
parts of his dress. Suspicion fell upon the Harpes,
who were pursued and apprehended near Crab Orchard.
They were taken to Stanford....”</p>

<p>The killing of the two Marylanders and the peddler
was not known until many weeks thereafter. The report
of the murder of Langford spread like wildfire.
<cite>The Kentucky Gazette</cite>, January 2, 1799, in a characteristically
brief paragraph gave sufficient details of the
discovery of the body on December 14 to impress its
readers with the seriousness of an act of barbarity that
might be repeated by the Harpes at any time. “We
also learn,” says this paragraph, “that Mr. Ballenger is
in pursuit of them, with a determined resolution never
to quit the chase until he has secured them.”</p>

<p>Captain Joseph Ballenger, the organizer and leader
of the pursuing party, was a prominent merchant of
Stanford, Lincoln County. He and his men trailed the
Harpes and their women to the neighborhood of what
was then Carpenter’s Station, a settlement near the
present town of Hustonville and about eight miles
southwest of Stanford. There Ballenger discovered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
them sitting on a log, evidently confident that no one
could detect their whereabouts. [<a href="#B12F">12<span class="smcap smaller">F</span></a>] The pursuers
rushed on them so suddenly that resistance or escape
was impossible.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>The five prisoners were taken to Stanford, placed in
jail and, about ten days later, tried before the Court of
Quarter Sessions.</p>

<p>Hall’s story of the frontier tragedy, based on personal
accounts that had survived for a quarter of a century,
has already been given. It is brief and is correct as far
as it goes, but while Hall was hearing it from the lips
of men who had it from those concerned with the
vengeance of the law, there lay in the custody of the
records of the backwoods court of Lincoln County, the
grim details of that crime of base ingratitude and cruelty
in solitude which so shook the Wilderness. They
had lain there forgotten more than a century when they
were found and examined in 1918. Yellowed with age,
written with the goose-quill pen of that period in a penmanship
characteristic of the pioneers, a jumble of half
narrative, half legal style, much of which, however, is
in use in courts today, these records of a terrible episode
in history are eloquent with interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
The piling up of item on item of court forms, of testimony
laboriously written out and signed, of official jail
accounts for the handling of the criminals, tells in its
own way every detail of a crime committed in fancied
obscurity yet which by a series of fortunate circumstances,
was to blaze into a notoriety that set all the
West on fire with fear and horror. One who holds these
long-forgotten records in his hands and curiously
searches them could, with patience and without the aid
of imagination, build up the story of frontier life and
the people who lived it. The story would show that the
power of observation exercised by some of the pioneers
was equal to any ascribed to a Sherlock Holmes. It
would be a story of chance incidents woven into chains
of circumstances that were to reveal crime with unerring
certainty—a story of the capture of the criminals,
of their life in jail, and of the destiny by which each of
the three women involved was to have her only child
born to her in that frontier jail, the branded fruit of
awful parentage. The mute entries in pounds, shillings,
and pence for every item, set down on these yellow
pages without malice or comment, tell their part of the
story as implacably and dispassionately as fate itself.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>These records show that all the Harpes gave their
name as “Roberts,” except Betsey Harpe, the supplementary
wife of Big Harpe, whose name is given as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
“Elizabeth Walker.” Five witnesses appeared against
them, two of whom—John Farris and his daughter-in-law,
Jane Farris—lived in the house near Rockcastle
River where Thomas Langford, or Lankford, was last
seen alive. The fugitives were captured December 25,
1798. On January 4, 1799, they appeared before the
three judges of the Lincoln County Court of Quarter
Sessions, as it is so recorded, by Willis Green, the clerk,
on the twenty-second page of the Record Book marked
“September 1798–March 1802:”</p>

<p>“At a court called and held at Lincoln Courthouse
on Friday the 4th day of January 1799 for the examination
of Micajah Roberts, Wiley Roberts, Susanna Roberts,
Sally Roberts, and Elizabeth Walker for the
murder of Thomas Langford.</p>

<p>“Present Hugh Logan, William Montgomery, and
Nathan Huston, Esquires, [the three judges who presided].</p>

<p>“The said [naming the five prisoners] were lead to
the bar in custody of the Sheriff and charged with
feloniously and of their malice aforethought murdering
and robbing a certain Thomas Langford on Wednesday
the 12th day of December 1798 on the road leading
from Kentucky to Virginia through the Wilderness,
and denied the fact, sundry evidences were therefore
examined and the prisoners heard in their defense.”</p>

<p>Five witnesses appeared on behalf of the Commonwealth.
The statement of each is written on loose
leaves and signed in the presence of Thomas Montgomery,
the official notary, and all were therefore in a
form to be turned over to a higher court should it become
necessary to do so. The affidavit of Captain Ballenger,
who lead the pursuing party, is here quoted in
full:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
“Joseph Ballenger of lawful age, and sworn, deposeth
and saith that at about the 19th or 20th day of
December 1798 he heard that a murder had been committed
in the Wilderness on the body of a certain
Thomas Langford, as supposed; that he, at the request
of James Blain the Attorney General of this Commonwealth
with others (including Thomas Welsh) went in
pursuit of some persons suspected of being the murderers
who had passed through Lincoln County; that they
went to the house of John Blain in Lincoln County
where they heard that persons similar to those they
were in pursuit of had left Brush Creek, a branch of
Green River, and passed over to the Rolling Fork of
Salt River; that they pursued them and overtook five
persons, the same who this day on their examinations
were called Micajah Roberts, Wiley Roberts, Susanna
Roberts, Sally Roberts, and Elizabeth Walker;
that after taking them into custody they proceeded to
search them and found in their possession a pocket
book with the name of Thomas Langford, a great coat,
a grey coating cloth, a short coat—in the pocket of it
were broken pieces of glass—a mixed colored long
coat, a pair of breeches, a shaving glass, a whip, a pair
of wrappers, and a horse, this day proved to be the
property of Thomas Langford said to be the person
murdered in the Wilderness, and that they found also
a Free Mason’s apron and many other things in their
possession said to be the property of Thomas Langford.
Further saith not.”</p>

<p>David Irby, in his sworn statement, explained that:
“he and Thomas Langford set out from Pittsylvania
County in Virginia for Kentucky, they traveled five
days journey together and sometimes one paid their
traveling expense and sometimes the other, all of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
Thomas Langford marked down in his pocket book.
Before they crossed Inglish’s Ferry [Ingle’s Ferry in
what is now Montgomery Country, Virginia] they got
a half bushel of oats which the deponent paid for and
also their ferryage at Inglish’s Ferry in Wythe County
(Virginia) the deponent purchased a cheese which
Thomas Langford set down in his pocket book, he says
that the pocket book now before the examining court
is the said pocket book which Thomas Langford had
when they traveled together in Tennessee State. [The
trail from Virginia to Cumberland Gap extended into
northeastern Tennessee before reaching Kentucky].
The deponent and Thomas Langford separated when
they agreed to meet at Frankfort in Kentucky; the deponent
heard in Kentucky that the said Thomas Langford
was murdered on his way to Kentucky, he set out
towards the place where the crime was committed and
went to the place where the person who was killed was
buried and he, the deponent, and John Farris unburied
and raised the decedent and found him to be Thomas
Langford.”</p>

<p>What Irby saw and heard he further declared convinced
him that the murdered man was no other than
his recent traveling companion.</p>

<p>John Farris Sr. swore that on Tuesday night, December
12, 1798: “a man came to his house on the Wilderness
Road who called himself Thomas Langford
and who, after he had told him his name, he recollected
to have been acquainted with in Pittsylvania County,
Virginia, in the youth of Thomas Langford.”</p>

<p>He said his guest remained all night and started the
next morning for the settlements. In the meantime,
Farris had: “an opportunity of viewing his clothing
and actually did very curiously examine the outward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
clothing of the said Thomas Langford.” A few days
later he heard that “a man was killed on the Wilderness
Road, and on inquiring into the circumstances he
was induced to believe that the person murdered was
Thomas Langford ... but not being fully satisfied
that the person found dead was Thomas Langford, he
went to the coroner of Lincoln County, obtained from
him an order—the said coroner having before that time
held an inquest on the body—and in pursuance of the
said order, in company with David Irby and Abraham
Anthony who buried the said Thomas Langford as he
supposed, raised him and inspected him ... and that
the whole visage of the person, by him and others
raised, answered his idea of Thomas Langford, but he
knew him more particularly by the loss of a tooth in
the front part of his jaw.”</p>

<p>His daughter-in-law, Jane Farris, wife of William
Farris, also identified various things found in the possession
of the outlaws as the property of the murdered
man. She evidently observed the actions of the travelers
closely, for she states: “Thomas Langford had on
leggins at her house and as part of the list of one of
them was torn Susan Roberts sewed it to the leggin
with white thread.” She adds that the five prisoners
and their victim came to the house together and “All
appeared very cheerful with each other, Langford
seemed to be somewhat intoxicated, he had a small
glass bottle which was filled with whiskey at their house
which Micajah Roberts and Wiley Roberts paid for.”
The six left the Farris house together, but shortly
before leaving “there was some misunderstanding between
Thomas Langford and Micajah and Wiley Roberts
... and Mr. Langford said to Mrs. Farris, in
the presence of all, that he would not offend her for all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
in his saddle bags which was worth five hundred
pounds.”</p>

<p>The statement made by Thomas Welsh, who was in
the pursuing party, is practically the same as Captain
Ballenger’s. He, however, adds “there was none of
the alteration in the great coat at the time of the finding
... and must have been made by the criminals
since they were taken into custody, they having, for
several days after they were taken in custody, the possession
of the great coat.”</p>

<p>There is nothing in the records to indicate what was
said by the prisoners when they were heard in their
defense. The decision of the court was that the five
prisoners “ought to be tried for the murder of the said
Thomas Langford before the Judges of the District
Court holden for the Danville District at the next
April Term, and it is ordered that they be remanded
to jail.”</p>

<p>Thomas Todd, the prosecuting attorney, in the requirement
of the law, “acknowledged himself indebted”
to the Governor of the Commonwealth “in the sum
of ten thousand pounds current money” should he fail
to appear before the judges on the first day of the April
term of the Danville District Court then and there to
prosecute the prisoners. The witnesses “acknowledged
themselves severally indebted ... to the sum of five
hundred pounds current money” should they fail to
appear and give evidence on behalf of the Commonwealth.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
On January 5 the five prisoners were taken by the
sheriff and a guard of seven men to Danville, there to
await trial before the District Court in April. The
distance from Stanford to Danville is about ten miles.
Neither history nor tradition tells how this cavalcade
made the trip over the trail, whether afoot, on horses,
or in wagons, or by a combination of these means. The
condition then reached by the women may have necessitated
the use of a conveyance for them. This party of
thirteen doubtless attracted much attention along the
road, for five prisoners, of whom three were women,
was a sight not often seen. The ten mile trip to Danville
made by the guards with the captured Harpes
along this historic highway, winding through an almost
unbroken forest, readily lends itself to anyone’s fancy.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>Evidently John Biegler, “Jailer of the District of
Danville,” to whom the prisoners were delivered and
who had them in his custody several months, felt there
was some likelihood of his charges escaping. His account
against the state shows that on January 20, 1799,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
he bought “Two horse locks to chain the men’s feet to
the ground, 12s. and 1 bolt, 3s.” It seems to have become
necessary to fasten the front door more firmly,
for, on February 13, he purchased “one lock for front
jail door, 18s.” Two weeks later he bought three
pounds of nails for 6s. “for the use of the jail.” The
expense items further show that four men, two at a
time, were employed to guard the prisoners.</p>

<p>But with all these precautions, the two Harpes escaped
on March 16, leaving their three women and
two new-born infants behind. There is nothing in the
court records indicating how they escaped. The jailer’s
expense account merely shows an item dated March
19: “Mending the wall in jail where the prisoners escaped,
12s.” Breazeale, forty years later, wrote—but
cites no authority for his statement: “the jailer, soon
after their escape, resigned his office, left the jail,
bought a farm and settled himself in the country where
he very shortly became wealthy—no one ever knew
with certainty by what means, but the general suspicion
was that he had acquired his wealth by receiving a
large bribe from the Harpes to permit them to escape.”</p>

<p>How they escaped was doubtless a subject of much
conjecture and discussion. Colonel Daniel Trabue in
his <cite>Autobiography</cite> says that the two men “took two
guns from the guard at Danville.” Whether or not the
guard or guards were present and resisted the prisoners
when they took the two guns is not stated. Judge
James Hall, continuing his brief account of the Langford
murder, quoted a few pages back, gives no details,
but simply ends with the statement: “They were taken
to Stanford where they were examined and committed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
by an enquiring court, sent to Danville for safe keeping,
and probably for trial. Previous to the time of trial
they made their escape.”</p>

<p>Nor do the records contain any hint as to how the
two men passed the time of their imprisonment. Lyman
C. Draper, in his “Sketch of the Harpes,” says
that shortly before his escape Big Harpe, contending
it would answer the ends of justice as well, proposed
to whip at fisticuffs the two best fighters in Kentucky,
provided he be set free if he succeeded in whipping
the men, and should he fail he would abide by the
decision of the court.</p>

<p>The trial of the three women was set for April 15.
But during the hundred days they were immured in
the log jail there was happening to them the immortal
trial that comes to their sex under all conditions.
Yoked as they were irregularly, pursuing as they had
the lives of the hunted and outcast, they had to bear, in
the rigors of winter, in abandonment and in prison
charged with murder, the burdens of motherhood—and
to such fathers! These items from the jailer’s accounts
of his expenditures on their behalf tell a story with
which imagination is free to work:</p>

<p>“February 8, ¼ lb. Hyson tea, 3s. 9d., 1 lb. sugar, 1s.
6d. for Betsey Walker she being brought to bed by a
son the preceding night, 5s. 3d.—February 10, ¼ lb.
ginger, 1s. 1d., 1 lb. sugar, 1s. 6d., for ditto, and paid
cash to the wife and other assistance 21s. £1. 3s. 7d.”—total
£1. 8s. 10d.</p>

<p>“March 7, ⅛ lb. tea, 1s. 10d., 1 lb. sugar, 1s. 6d., for
the use of Susanna Harpe brought to bed by a daughter
the preceding night, 3s. 4d. Paid cash midwife for
ditto, 18s.”—total £1. 1s. 4d.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
“April 9, ¼ lb. tea, 3s. 9d., 1 lb. sugar, 1s. 6d., 1 quart
whiskey, 1s. 6d. for the use of Sally Harp brought to
bed the preceding night by a daughter.”—total 6s. 9d.</p>

<p>It will be noted that when the third child was born a
week before the time set for trial—the second was
about a month old and the other two months old.</p>

<p>Such was the state of affairs when, on Monday, April
15, 1799, the clerk turned to page 314 of the Danville
District Court Order Book and there began his record
of the trial of the three women indicted for the murder
of Thomas Langford. The court was presided over by
Judge James G. Hunter and by Judge Samuel McDowell,
who served in the absence of Judge Stephen
Ormsby. “Susanna Roberts, spinster of Lincoln County
was set to the bar in custody of the jailer,” so runs the
record, and pleaded “not guilty;” but “for reasons appearing
to the court” her trial was postponed until the
third day of the term. “Elizabeth Walker” and “Sally
Roberts” were not called on to appear personally that
day before the judges, but their cases were postponed
until the 18th.</p>

<p>On the 17th “Susanna Roberts” again appeared in
court. A jury of twelve men was sworn, which, after
hearing the same evidence given in Stanford, presented
in the form of written affidavits, declared her “guilty.”</p>

<p>On the 18th another jury was sworn and “Elizabeth
Walker, spinster of Lincoln County,” was tried on the
same evidence presented against “Susanna Roberts,”
but found “not guilty.” The court proceedings of
that afternoon show that the judge “saith he will not
further prosecute the said Sally Roberts (spinster of
Lincoln County) ... and therefore it is considered
by the court that she be acquitted.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
Thus, with the same evidence against each woman,
one was found “guilty,” and one “not guilty” and one
was “acquitted.”</p>

<p>On the 19th Susanna, who had been found guilty, appealed
for a new trial and it was granted. The Attorney
General, however, concluded not to prosecute her,
and, at his suggestion, the clerk was ordered to record
“certain of the reasons which moved him to enter into
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">nolle prosequi</i> in this case ... to-wit: Upon considering
the circumstances attending the case of Susanna
Roberts and although she has been found guilty of the
charge in the indictment contained by a verdict of her
peers, yet as Eliza Walker has been tried on the same
indictment, on which trial the said Eliza was found
not guilty and the same proof produced against her as
was produced against the said Susanna, and in consequence
also of the Court having granted a new trial
and from the probability [of the evidence] which
would be produced on the trial of the said Susanna at
the next term by the two other women, in the same indictment
contained, who are acquitted and discharged,
operating in favor of the prisoner, and also by the
advice of the prosecutor and of the Court, and also to
save to the Commonwealth the expenses which attend
her long detention and further prosecution, I have
been induced to direct the Clerk to enter a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">nolle prosequi</i>
as to the said Susanna Roberts.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_5">The Harpes—Renewal of the Terror</h2>
</div>

<p>What had happened to the Harpes and their women
was a natural outcome of the frontier outlook upon life.
The three mothers had gained the sympathy of the
court and the community in their apparent distress and
helplessness. It was believed that they had obtained a
happy release from their barbarous masters. It is probable
that many of the persons who now helped in the
hunt for the escaped Harpes did so not because they
were highway murderers and should therefore be shot
or hanged, but because they deserved particular punishment
for their brutal conduct toward the young women.
At any rate the settlements were united in the pursuit
of the two men, who had so curiously escaped.</p>

<p>The acquitted women declared that, above all things,
they desired to return to Knoxville and there start life
over again. A collection of clothes and money was
made among the citizens of Danville and an old mare
was given to help them on their way to Tennessee. The
three women, each with a bundle over her shoulder and
a child under her arm, and the old mare loaded down
with clothes and bedding, left the jail one morning on
what was considered no easy journey even when undertaken
with good horses and the best of equipment. They
walked down the street in Indian file, led by the jailer,
who accompanied them to the edge of town to point
out the road that led through Crab Orchard to Tennessee.
These forlorn and dejected travelers, however,
had covered less than thirty miles when they changed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
their course and went down along the banks of Green
River. A few days later they traded their horse for a
canoe and then went down the stream and were soon
lost sight of by the spies who attempted to watch them.
[<a href="#B12F">12<span class="smcap smaller">F</span></a>]</p>

<p>The brutal killing of Langford had stirred the country
for almost two months, and now that the murderers
had escaped and the gnawed bones of the two Marylanders
were found, with all evidence pointing to the
Harpes as the perpetrators of this terrible murder, the
citizens became even more enraged. They were aroused
to the realization that the villains must be captured and
disposed of at once. The case required prompt action
and any and all methods that might bring about the extermination
of the Harpes were endorsed.</p>

<p>On March 28, 1799, <cite>The Kentucky Gazette</cite> published
the following paragraph: “The criminals in the
Danville district jail for the murder of Mr. Langford,
(as mentioned in our paper of the 2nd of January last)
have made their escape. By an order from W. E.
Strong, Esq., a justice of the peace for Mercer County,
all sheriffs and constables are commanded to take and
re-commit them.”</p>

<p>An entry in the Danville District Court Order Book,
page 370, under date of April 22, 1799, reads: “It is
ordered that the Commonwealth’s writ of capias issue
from the clerk’s office of this Court to the Sheriff of
Lincoln County commanding him to take Micajah Roberts
and Wiley Roberts who have lately broken the
jail of this District and are now running at large and
them, the said Micajah Roberts and Wiley Roberts,
safely to keep so that he have their bodies before the
Judges of the District Court holden for the Danville
District on the first day of their August Term, to answer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
for the felony and murder of a certain Thomas Langford
whereof they stand indicted.”</p>

<p>Lynching parties had been organized since the
middle of March and in the meantime a committee
was sent to James Garrard, Governor of Kentucky, presenting
to him the necessity of capturing the outlaws.
A memorandum on this subject in the Executive Journal,
entered in the month of April, states that “the
governor authorized Josh Ballenger to pursue them
into the state of Tennessee and other states, and to apply
to the executive authorities of such states to deliver
them up.”</p>

<p>Ballenger and his men began their chase before they
received official notice of the governor’s action, and
were soon on the trail. Near the headwaters of Rolling
Fork, a branch of Salt River, they suddenly found
themselves face to face with the Harpes, who, although
surprised, were prepared to shoot. The pursuers retreated
in confusion and the Harpes, taking advantage
of the situation, made their escape. Henry Scaggs, one
of the party, suggested that the crowd go to his farm
and, with the aid of his dogs, continue the chase.
Scaggs was one of the “Long Hunters” who came to
Kentucky in 1770 with Colonel James Knox and a pioneer
who had ever since been looked upon as “a valiant
man in battle and a great hunter.” Urged by him they
resumed the pursuit and continued it until late that
night, when most of the men, becoming discouraged,
left the party because the trail of the Harpes led them
through very thick and almost impenetrable cane.</p>

<p>A few men, led by Ballenger, continued the search,
but in a section where the heavy cane was no impediment.
Scaggs, believing the canebrake should be penetrated,
went to a “log rolling” a few miles north of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
home of Colonel Daniel Trabue, and there, with the
aid of Major James Blain, tried to organize another
party. But the men declared that the cane was too
thick and the chances of capture too slight to justify
the risk, and the “log rolling” went on. Scaggs then—on
or about April 10—rode to the farm of Colonel
Daniel Trabue, a Revolutionary soldier and one of the
most prominent and altruistic of Kentucky pioneers,
who lived about three miles west of what is now
Columbia, Adair County.</p>

<p>While Scaggs was discussing his plans with Colonel
Trabue, the Colonel was patiently awaiting the return
of his son, John Trabue, a lad of thirteen, who had
been sent to one of the neighbors to borrow some flour
and seed beans. The boy was accompanied by a small
dog, and, in the midst of the discussion, the dog walked
into the yard badly wounded. [<a href="#B12E">12<span class="smcap smaller">E</span></a>] An investigation
was immediately made. The neighbor reported that
the boy had left the house a few hours before with the
flour and beans. All efforts made that night to find him
were futile. They began to suspect that he might have
been kidnapped by the Harpes. The search continued
for many days, but all in vain. Evidence of the Harpes
was discovered by George Spears and five other men
about fifteen miles southwest of the Trabue farm, near
the East Fork of Barren River, where the outlaws had
killed a calf and made moccasins out of the skin, leaving
their old moccasins behind. The footprints indicated
the presence of two men, but there were no signs
to show that a boy was with them. [<a href="#B63">63</a>]</p>

<p>Little did the pursuers realize what had actually
happened. The innocent lad, walking home over an
old buffalo trace, had met the Harpes as they were
crossing it. There they killed the little fellow, cut his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
body to pieces, and threw it into a sinkhole near the
path, where it remained hidden about two weeks and
was then discovered by accident. The murderers had
taken the flour but not the seed beans.</p>

<p>Colonel Trabue, in his autobiography or journal,
written some twenty-five years after this tragedy, deplores
the fact that the log rollers did not continue the
pursuit: “It is a pity they did not go, for then John
Trabue might not have been killed.” He adds that
these men ever after “reflected very much on themselves
for their negligence, and said this ought to be a
warning to others hereafter to always do their duty.”</p>

<p>In pioneer times the execution of the law by officials
was in many instances an unavoidably slow process, and
it therefore frequently became necessary for the law
abiding citizens to organize themselves into bands and,
by any method the emergency might demand, establish
order and safety. No matter how achieved, preserving
peace and fighting danger was looked upon by good
citizens as the imperative duty of all. Had the then
slow-acting laws been relied upon, the sly and quick-traveling
Harpes probably would not have been captured
for years, and their victims might have been
numbered by the hundreds. On the other hand, as suggested
by Colonel Trabue, it is possible that had the
men who were called upon by Scaggs done what was
in those days considered a duty, Langford might have
been the last victim of the Harpes and their career
ended.</p>

<p>A report that mad dogs were running through the
country and were likely to spring from behind any bush
or tree at any time could not have alarmed the people
more than did the realization that the Harpes had escaped
from jail and were killing all who chanced to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
in their path. On April 22, the Governor of Kentucky
was again appealed to for help, and he immediately
signed a proclamation which was published in the
Frankfort <cite>Palladium</cite> on May 2 and May 9, 1799:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center b1">“BY THE GOVERNOR, A PROCLAMATION.</p>

<p>“Whereas it has been represented to me that <span class="smcap smaller">MICAJAH
HARP</span>, alias <span class="smcap smaller">ROBERTS</span>, and <span class="smcap smaller">WILEY HARP</span> alias <span class="smcap smaller">ROBERTS</span>,
who were confined in the jail of the Danville district
under a charge of murder, did on the 16th day of
March last, break out of the said jail;—and whereas
the ordinary methods of pursuit have been found ineffectual
for apprehending and restoring to confinement
the said fugitives, I have judged it necessary to the
safety and welfare of the community and to the maintenance
of justice, to issue this my proclamation and do
hereby offer and promise a reward of <span class="smcap smaller">THREE HUNDRED
DOLLARS</span> to any person who shall apprehend and deliver
into the custody of the jailer of the Danville district
the said <span class="smcap smaller">MICAJAH HARP</span> alias <span class="smcap smaller">ROBERTS</span> and a like reward
of <span class="smcap smaller">THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS</span> for apprehending and
delivering as aforesaid the said <span class="smcap smaller">WILEY HARP</span> alias <span class="smcap smaller">ROBERTS</span>,
to be paid out of the public treasury agreeably to
law.</p>

<p>“In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand
and have caused the seal of the Commonwealth to be
affixed.</p>

<p>“Done at Frankfort on the 22nd day of April in the
year of our Lord 1799, and of the Commonwealth the
seventh.</p>

<p class="in0 in2">
“(L. S.)<br />
“By the Governor <span class="in12"><span class="smcap">James Garrard</span></span><br />
“Harry Toulmin, Secretary.
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap smaller">MICAJAH HARP</span> alias <span class="smcap smaller">ROBERTS</span> is about six feet high—of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
a robust make, and is about 30 or 32 years of age. He
has an ill-looking, downcast countenance, and his hair
is black and short, but comes very much down his forehead.
He is built very straight and is full fleshed in
the face. When he went away he had on a striped nankeen
coat, dark blue woolen stockings,—leggins of drab
cloth and trousers of the same as the coat.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap smaller">WILEY HARP</span> alias <span class="smcap smaller">ROBERTS</span> is very meagre in his
face, has short black hair but not quite so curly as his
brother’s; he looks older, though really younger, and
has likewise a downcast countenance. He had on a
coat of the same stuff as his brother’s, and had a drab
surtout coat over the close-bodied one. His stockings
were dark blue woolen ones, and his leggins of drab
cloth.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before this proclamation by the Governor had time
to circulate throughout the state, report reached the
people that the Harpes had killed a man named Dooley,
near what is now Edmonton, Metcalfe County,
[<a href="#B28">28</a>] and had butchered another named Stump, who
lived on Barren River about eight miles below Bowling
Green. [<a href="#B12D">12<span class="smcap smaller">D</span></a>]</p>

<p>Stump was fishing, and seeing smoke rising on the
opposite side of the river, a little distance from the
bank, presumed some new arrivals were preparing to
settle. He stepped into his cabin and got his violin,
and then crossed the stream to greet the newcomers.
He was clad in his shirt and trousers, without hat or
shoes, but he probably felt that what he lacked in wearing
apparel would be more than counterbalanced by
the hearty welcome to the Wilderness he was prepared
to give his new neighbors. So, in this scant attire, and
with a turkey over his shoulder, a string of fish in one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
hand and his fiddle under his arm, he entered their
camp. He probably never realized that his good intentions
had led him into the hands of the Harpes. They
stabbed him, cut open his body, filled it with stones and
threw it into the river. [<a href="#B12F">12<span class="smcap smaller">F</span></a>] Some of Stump’s neighbors,
says <cite>The Kentucky Gazette</cite>, were suspected of
having committed the murder and were taken into
custody, but an investigation proved their innocence
and also proved beyond all doubt that the Harpes were
the perpetrators of the crime.</p>

<p>The criminals continued their raid down Barren
River into the lower Green River country to a point
near Henderson, Kentucky, and then, either by land
or water, rapidly worked their way to Diamond Island
in the Ohio and to Cave-in-Rock, in or near any of
which places they evidently had arranged to meet their
women.</p>

<p>How many men, women, and children these two
brothers killed and what course they followed while
rushing through the lower Green River country and
the Ohio Valley between Henderson and Cave-in-Rock
will never be known. Shortly before reaching the
Cave, they committed a murder in Illinois at the mouth
of Saline River, about twelve miles above Cave-in-Rock.
Twenty-six years later this incident was briefly
summed up in the <cite>Illinois Gazette</cite>, published at Shawneetown:
“There are persons living in this country
whom we have heard recount the story of the Harpes
with great minuteness, and the place is still pointed
out, on the plantation of Mr. Potts, near the mouth of
the Saline River, where they shot two or three persons
in cold blood by the fire where they had encamped.”
[<a href="#B56">56</a>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
The many reports—some false and others only too
true—of the inhuman acts committed by the Harpes
had, in the meantime, put every community on its
guard. Captain Ballenger, after pursuing the outlaws
a few weeks, found that, owing to the many conflicting
rumors, he had been thrown off the trail and was moving
in a direction opposite the one taken by the Harpes
and, therefore, he gave up the chase.</p>

<p>Captain Young, of Mercer County, in the meantime
organized a company with the determination to exterminate
the Harpes and all other outlaws, or at least
drive them out of the country. Commenting on Captain
Young’s expedition, Edmund L. Starling, author
of <cite>A History of Henderson County, Kentucky</cite>, writes:
“Captain Young and his men recognized the perils of
their undertaking; they understood the wily machinations
of the enemy, and, with blood for blood emblazoned
upon their banner, started upon their mission of
capture or death, utterly regardless of their own personal
comforts or the hardships attending a campaign
in such a wild and comparatively unmarked country.”</p>

<p>Having met with success in Mercer, Captain Young
and his men continued their pursuit and finally reached
Henderson County. There they were joined by a number
of citizens. The combined forces swept over the
entire country, including Diamond Island, driving the
outlaws out of that part of Kentucky across the Ohio
River into Illinois. A number of the criminals fled to
Cave-in-Rock. The character of the men who usually
centered at the Cave was well known to the refugees, for
many of them had helped to make the place notorious.</p>

<p>Captain Young and his outlaw exterminators having
covered the territory they set out to relieve, left Henderson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
County and returned to Mercer County—a distance
of more than one hundred and fifty miles—and
were there given a grand ovation. [<a href="#B124">124</a>]</p>

<p>Governor Garrard, however, must have felt somewhat
apprehensive regarding the return of the Harpes,
for the Executive Journal shows that on June 7 he
“deputed Alexander McFarland and brothers” to take
charge of “these inveterate enemies of human happiness”
should they be found “in any adjacent state.”</p>

<p>It seems quite likely that while in the Danville jail
the Harpe women, by some means, sent a message to, or
received one from, “old man Roberts,” the father-in-law
of Big Harpe, who then lived in Russell County, Kentucky.
At any rate, as already stated, they started down
Green River shortly after leaving Danville. They
paddled their way down that river until they reached
its mouth, a distance of more than two hundred miles.
After stopping in the neighborhood of Henderson, they
continued down the Ohio about ninety miles to Cave-in-Rock.
It was in this section of the Ohio Valley
that they expected, sooner or later, to meet the Harpes.
Tradition has it that shortly after the three women arrived
at Cave-in-Rock two of them proceeded up the
river, one to Diamond Island and the other to a neighborhood
south of Henderson, while the third remained
at the Cave; and in this manner they watchfully awaited
the arrival of the Harpes. The two women who had
been loitering near Henderson and Diamond Island,
posing under assumed names as widows, either had left
their watching places voluntarily or were forced to flee
from them with their husbands. At any rate, they finally
arrived at Cave-in-Rock and there, in a very short
time, the two Harpes and their three women and three
children were once more united.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
As a result of Captain Young’s raid through Henderson
County, Cave-in-Rock became somewhat crowded
with outlaws. Realizing that their number was too
great to maneuver with any secrecy and safety, many
left the place voluntarily, some continuing down the
river, others working their way inland, and a few remaining
“to pursue their nefarious avocation.” [<a href="#B124">124</a>]</p>

<p>The Harpes, however, were driven from the Cave.
This aggregation of outlaws was doubtless a depraved
conglomeration of evil doers, but in the Harpes they
found two human brutes beyond even their toleration.</p>

<p>There is a tradition to the effect that the Harpes had
been at the Cave only a few days when they brazenly
related the performance of an act which, to their surprise,
was not cheered by their companions. A flatboat
had come down the river and its passengers, not realizing
they were near the famous rendezvous of outlaws,
landed about a quarter of a mile above the Cave at the
foot of a small bluff, later known as Cedar Point.
Among the travelers on board were a young man and
his sweetheart who, while their companions were making
some repairs to the boat, strolled to the top of the
cliff and there sat down upon a rock. The view from
that point is still beautiful and was probably even
more so in primeval days. While the two lovers were
sitting on the edge of the cliff with their backs to the
wild woods behind them, leisurely considering the
landscape, or the life before them, the two Harpes
quietly approached from the forest and, without a word
of warning, pushed the lovers off the cliff. They fell
on a sandy beach forty feet below and, to the surprise
of all, escaped unhurt. The Harpes returned to the
Cave, and, as already stated, boasted, but without the
expected effect, of the prank they had played.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
Shortly after this, two families, carrying a supply of
tools and provisions, were floating down the Ohio in a
flatboat, intending to settle in Smithland, but when they
came near Cave-in-Rock they were captured and
robbed by the outlaws. The two or three passengers
who were not killed in the battle preceding the robbery,
were brought ashore. The Harpes, seeing an opportunity
to give their fellow criminals an exhibition of
brutality, stripped one of the captives, tied him to a
blindfolded horse and led the animal to the top of the
bluff over the Cave. By wild shouts and other means
the horse was frightened and at the same time forced
to run toward the edge of the cliff, and before long the
blindfolded animal with the naked man tied on its
back ran off the bluff and fell a distance of more than
one hundred feet to the rough and rocky shore below.
Then the Harpes pointed to the mangled remains of
man and horse as evidence of another triumph over law
and order. Their fellow cave dwellers probably had
never seen such a sight before and evidently did not
care to witness one again. It is likely that only sympathy
for their women and babies saved the Harpes from
death at the hands of the other outlaws. All the Harpes
left the Cave at once.</p>

<p>It is probable that their hasty departure took place
some time in May, 1799. Neither history nor tradition
tells in what direction they fled. The people of
Kentucky doubtless concluded that since they had
driven these outlaws across the Ohio into Illinois, they
would continue their flight north or proceed by flatboat
to some section along the lower Mississippi.</p>

<p>About the middle of July east Tennessee was shocked
to hear of the cruel murder of a farmer named Bradbury,
who was killed along the road in Roane County,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
about twenty-five miles west of Knoxville on what has
since been known as Bradbury’s Ridge. [<a href="#B21">21</a>] The
Harpes were not suspected of the crime, for the impression
prevailed that they had fled permanently and, although
their whereabouts was unknown, it not only
seemed quite improbable but almost impossible that
they had returned in so short a time. It soon developed,
however, that they actually had made their appearance
again, for a few days later—July 22, 1799—they murdered
a young son of Chesley Coffey, on Black Oak
Ridge, about eight miles northwest of Knoxville. One
version has it that the boy was hunting strayed cows
and while in the woods was slain by the Harpes, who
took his gun and the shoes he wore, and left his body
lying under a tree. [<a href="#B12G">12<span class="smcap smaller">G</span></a>] Another account is that
“Young Coffey was riding along the road one evening
to get a fiddle. These terrible men smeared a tree with
his brains, making out that his horse had run against
the tree.” [<a href="#B63">63</a>]</p>

<p>Two days later they killed a man named William
Ballard, who lived within a few miles of Knoxville.
“They cut him open and, putting stones in his body,
sank it in the river.” [<a href="#B63">63</a>] It was believed by the neighbors
that the Harpes mistook Ballard for Hugh Dunlap,
who had been active in endeavoring to arrest them
the year before. [<a href="#B21">21</a>]</p>

<p>The Harpes continued their course northward. They
crossed Emery River, near what is now Harriman
Junction, and, while their women were resting for a
few days in some secluded spot, the two men skirmished
alone in Morgan County. On July 29, on the spur of a
mountain since known as Brassel’s Knob, they met
James and Robert Brassel. James Brassel was afoot
and carried a gun; Robert was on horseback and unarmed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
The Harpes, who were riding good horses,
pretended to be in a hurry, but seeming to have a desire
to comply with the custom of civilized travelers, slowed
up and saluted the men with the question: “What’s the
news?” The Brassels related in detail an account of
the murder of William Ballard and young Coffey. The
Harpes replied that they had not only heard of these
tragedies, but that they were now in pursuit of the men
who had committed the crimes. They further asserted
that they were going to wait for the rest of the pursuing
party which was coming on behind, and requested the
Brassels to join them when the reinforcements arrived.
To this the two innocent brothers willingly agreed.
They had no more than done so when Big Harpe,
accusing them of being the Harpe brothers, seized
James Brassel’s gun, threw it on the ground and immediately
began tying his hands and feet. Robert, suspecting
that he and his brother had fallen into the hands of
the dreaded Harpes themselves, jumped from his horse
and attempted to obtain his brother’s gun in an effort to
rescue him. In this he failed and, realizing that his
only hope of escape was flight, he ran into the woods,
leaving his horse behind. He was pursued by Little
Harpe, whom he succeeded in outrunning, and, although
shot at, he was unhurt.</p>

<p>Robert continued his flight about ten miles when he
met a Mr. Dale, who, with two or three other men and
Mrs. Dale, was traveling toward Knoxville. He persuaded
them to return with him to the place where he
had left his brother. The men had only one gun among
them for their protection; nevertheless they tried to
help the bewildered man. When they reached the spot
in the woods a short distance from the road where
Robert had left his brother, they were horrified to find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
that James was not only dead, but that his body had
been “much beaten and his throat cut.” His gun was
broken to pieces. The tracks indicated that the two
Harpes had gone toward Knoxville, from which direction
they were coming when they overtook the Brassel
brothers. After the pursuers had followed the tracks
a few miles, they were much surprised to find themselves
running upon the Harpes coming back. At the
time the two Brassels were attacked by the Harpes the
outlaws were alone and had with them nothing but their
guns. But now, on their return, they were accompanied
by their women and children, heavily loaded with
clothing and provisions, apparently prepared for a long
journey and for battle and siege.</p>

<p>When this fierce procession of men and women on
horseback came in sight, one of Dale’s men suggested
that if the approaching cavalcade showed no signs of
fight, no effort to arrest them should be made. This immediately
met with the approval of the majority. No
attempt to fight was made. The murderers, in the words
of Colonel Trabue, “looked very awful at them” and
then passed on. The pursuers, too, continued their
journey for a while in silence, lest any words they
should utter might be overheard and mistaken by the
Harpes as a threat. Robert Brassel complained bitterly
of the lack of courage displayed by the men he
had relied upon to help capture or kill the murderers
of his brother. [<a href="#B63">63</a>]</p>

<p>Thus, uninterrupted, the two Harpes and their
wives, with their stolen horses and other plunder, and
with an ever-increasing desire to shed blood, continued
their expedition to Kentucky. Somewhere near the
Tennessee-Kentucky line, either in what is now Pickett
County, Tennessee, or Clinton County, Kentucky, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
killed John Tully, who lived in that section of Cumberland
County which in 1835 became a part of Clinton
County.</p>

<p>In the meantime citizens of east Tennessee were
alarmed. They now fully realized that the Harpes had
actually returned and were likely to appear any day in
any neighborhood. Every man carried his gun, his
dirk, or carving knife, and made every preparation to
slay the monsters.</p>

<p>Robert Brassel resumed his pursuit of the Harpes
and was soon joined by William Wood and others.
When they arrived near the farm of John Tully they
met Nathaniel Stockton and a number of neighbors
looking for Tully, who they supposed was lost in the
woods. The search continued and “near the road they
found Mr. Tully, killed, and hidden under a log.” [<a href="#B63">63</a>]
The company buried him and some of the men agreed
they would pursue the murderers.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>Immediately after it was discovered that Tully had
been murdered, William Wood and Nathaniel Stockton
started afoot to Colonel Daniel Trabue’s farm, a
distance of forty miles. They suspected that because
Colonel Trabue had been active in the pursuit of the
Harpes after his son had been murdered, the monsters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
were on their way to his home and store and might be
captured there. They related to the Colonel the details
of the crimes the Harpes had recently committed and
he, before they had finished, decided to forward the
news to the governor of Kentucky. In order to impress
the governor with the fact that the report was not another
wild rumor, Colonel Trabue, who was a justice of
the peace in Green County, prepared a written statement,
giving a brief account of the recent acts of the
Harpes, as related to him by Nathaniel Stockton and
William Wood, and forwarded it to him in the form of
an affidavit. [<a href="#B63">63</a>]</p>

<p>This sworn statement, consisting of about five hundred
words, was published in the <cite>Kentucky Gazette</cite> on
August 15, 1799. From it some of the details of the
three crimes just related were taken. It begins with the
declaration: “About the middle of July there was a
man killed by the name of Hardin, about three miles
below Knoxville: he was ripped open and stones put
in his belly, and he was thrown into Holston River.”
After briefly noting the circumstances and the exact
date of the killing of Coffey, James Brassel, and John
Tully, it calls attention to the fact that the night after
the Harpes murdered Tully “they passed by old Mr.
Stockton’s going toward their father’s-in-law, old Mr.
Roberts.” A point of great human interest is the concise
and vivid description of the two Harpes given in
the affidavit prepared by Colonel Trabue: “The big
man is pale, dark, swarthy, bushy hair, had a reddish
gun stock—the little man had a blackish gunstock, with
a silver star with four straight points—they had short
sailor’s coats, very dirty, and grey greatcoats.”</p>

<p>Colonel Trabue, in his <cite>Autobiography</cite>, does not give
a copy of his affidavit, but relative to it, he writes: “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
sent out that night for some neighbors and made arrangements.
We sent one man off the next morning by
sunrise to Frankfort to the Governor, that he might
have it published in the newspapers. Mr. Wood’s and
Mr. Stockton’s statement I wrote down and had them
swear to it, what they knew of their own knowledge
and what Robert Brassel had told them. I sent another
man down to Yellow Banks [should read Red Banks]
to General Samuel Hopkins with the news and the statement.
I directed the men to go as fast as they could,
and spread the news as they went; it was also immediately
put in the newspapers. The man I sent to General
Hopkins was John Ellis. As he went on he spread the
news. He happened to go the same route the Harpes
had taken. When they heard of him they pursued and
tried to overtake him. Ellis had a good horse and went
sixty or seventy miles a day. The whole state got in a
great uproar, because it was uncertain which route the
murderers would take.”</p>

<p>The two messengers sent by Colonel Trabue rode
over trails that wound through a sparsely populated
wilderness where danger in one form or another was
likely to be encountered at any moment. One rider
dashed in a northerly direction about ninety miles,
while the other rushed westward twice that distance.
Each “spread the news” along his route, and from
every settlement he passed, the report—“The Harpes are
here”—was hurriedly sent out. The warning, in comparatively
little time, reached practically every family
in Kentucky and many in Tennessee. The press verified
the reports and soon the people saw for themselves in
“black and white,” which was then considered the garb
of “gospel truth,” that the Harpes had returned to Kentucky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
and were guilty of crimes even more brutal than
any heretofore perpetrated.</p>

<p>The Frankfort <cite>Palladium</cite>, on August 15, 1799, published
the names of four men and on what day in July
each was killed by the Harpes, and concludes its paragraph
with the statement that “we are happy to hear
they are closely pursued and sincerely hope they will
ere long meet the punishment which the atrocity of
their crimes demands.” <cite>The Western Spy and Hamilton
Gazette</cite>, of Cincinnati, on September 3 published a
Frankfort news item giving practically the same facts
and expressing the same hope.</p>

<p>Such widespread terror and fear as was aroused by
the raid of the Harpes found expression, no doubt, not
only in the <cite>Kentucky Gazette</cite> and the <cite>Palladium</cite>, but
in all the papers published in Kentucky and Tennessee.
Stewart’s <cite>Kentucky Herald</cite>, of Lexington, the <cite>Mirror</cite>,
of Washington, Mason County, Kentucky, and the <cite>Gazette</cite>
and the <cite>Impartial Observer</cite>, both of Knoxville,
Tennessee, were in existence at the time. Careful research
in these four papers has failed to reveal any allusion
to the Harpes, for the copies available are of other
dates than those likely to mention these outlaws in their
presentation of current events. It is possible that a
number of current newspapers in the east and south
printed more or less about the Harpes and thus warned
the people of the possibility of their sudden appearance.
As we shall see later, the <cite>Carolina Gazette</cite>, of Charleston,
South Carolina, in its issue of October 24, 1799,
devoted twenty-five lines to the Harpes. This story, in
all probability, was not its first and only paragraph
relative to them.</p>

<p>Although the alarm was being spread by the people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
and the press, and many a man had prepared to slay the
outlaws, the report of the latest butchery was soon followed
by another. The day after Colonel Trabue sent
the messengers to Frankfort and Henderson, the Harpes
traveled up Marrowbone Creek and, about twenty-five
miles south of Colonel Trabue’s home, stopped at an
out-of-the-way place on which John Graves and his
thirteen-year-old son were cultivating a crop and making
preparations for the rest of the family to join them.
[<a href="#B63">63</a>]</p>

<p>The Harpes arrived at their cabin late in the evening
and got permission to spend the night. “Early in the
morning, probably before the Graveses awoke, they,
with Graves’ own axe, split the heads of both open and
threw the bodies of both in to the brush fence that surrounded
the house.” “There they lay,” writes Draper,
in one of his note books, “until some one, seeing so
many buzzards around, made an investigation and discovered
what had taken place.” [<a href="#B12E">12<span class="smcap smaller">E</span></a>] This tragedy was
announced in the <cite>Palladium</cite> of August 22, in a paragraph
quoted from the <cite>Guardian of Freedom</cite>, Frankfort,
Kentucky. The statement then published is another
verification of the notes made by Draper many
years later.</p>

<p>From the Graves cabin they traveled north twenty
miles or more into Russell County to the home of old
man Roberts, the reputed father of the two women Big
Harpe claimed as wives. The only reference to this
“old Mr. Roberts” is in Colonel Trabue’s affidavit sent
to the Governor of Kentucky in August, 1799. Local
tradition has nothing to say about Roberts—when he
came or left, or where his cabin stood. Evidently he
was still living in Russell County in 1802, for in November
of that year Reverend Jacob Young, a Methodist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
preacher, met “a brother-in-law of the infamous
Micajah Harpe,” who, although his name is not stated
in the preacher’s autobiography, must have been a son
of the “old Mr. Roberts” in order to qualify for the
connection. At any rate, two of the Harpe women were
doubtless invited by their father to remain with him.
If, however, such an invitation was not extended, the
women would have appealed to him for help had they
been inclined to reform, and he, as many other fathers
would have done, might have consented to make an
effort to lead them from the vile associations into which
they had fallen. What these two daughters might and
should have done they failed to do. They clung to
their companions in crime and with them fled westward
south of Green River toward Mammoth Cave and Russellville.</p>

<p>While on the way the Harpes killed a little girl and
a negro boy. Writers do not agree as to just where and
when these two murders took place. It is likely they
were enacted while the Harpes were going to Logan
County and that they led up to a third child-murder
even more inhuman. The first of these tragedies, as
briefly related by Breazeale, is that “they met with a
negro boy going to mill, dashed the boy’s brains out
against a tree, but left the horse and bag of grain untouched.”
The other recorded by Collins is equally
brief: “One of their victims was a little girl found at
some distance from her home, whose tender age and
helplessness would have been protection against any
but incarnate fiends.”</p>

<p>They soon reached Logan County. There, according
to T. Marshall Smith, they discovered, about eight
miles from Drumgool’s station, now Adairville, the two
Trisword brothers, who with their wives, several children,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
and a few black servants, were camping for the
night. The next morning before sunrise, while the
emigrants were still asleep, the Harpes and two Cherokee
Indians made a wild attack on the tent occupied by
the travelers and killed the entire party except one of
the men, who ran for help. When the rescuing party
arrived upon the scene it found the ground covered
with the bodies of the dead, some of them badly
mangled. While several of the men were occupied
burying the dead, others were looking for evidence of
the direction the outlaws had taken.</p>

<p>This account, because it lacks verification, is not here
presented as one true in its details. It is known, however,
that as a result of this tragedy or because of some
other atrocity committed about this time by the Harpes,
William Stewart, sheriff of Logan County, organized
a party of about a dozen men to search for the highwaymen.
This pursuing party, having reason to believe
that the outlaws were traveling south, rushed toward
the Tennessee line. In the meantime, however, the cunning
Harpes were working their way northward. They
stopped a few hours about three miles northeast of Russellville,
on the Samuel Wilson Old Place, about half
a mile up Mud River from what is now Duncan’s
bridge over Mud River on the Russellville and Morgantown
road. There the Harpes watered their horses
at the same spring that quenched the thirst of the hundreds
of people who a few weeks before attended the
Great Revival conducted by the Reverends John and
William McGee and James M’Gready. Samuel Wilson,
an eye witness, in his description of this religious
meeting, says: “Fires were built, cooking begun, and by
dark candles lighted and fixed on a hundred trees
around and interspersing the ground surrounded by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
tents, showing forth the first, and as I believe still, one
of the most beautiful camp meetings the world has ever
seen.” This was one of the first of the Great Revival
meetings that so spontaneously stirred what was then
called the West. The Harpes doubtless knew or inferred
from the condition of the place that it had been
used recently for religious purposes. [<a href="#B121">121</a>]</p>

<p>The Harpe men had no patience with their children
and often reprimanded the three women, declaring that
the crying infants would some day be the means of pursuers
detecting their presence. They frequently threatened
to kill them. To protect their babies, the mothers
many a night went apart, carrying their children sufficiently
far away to prevent their cries being heard by
the unnatural fathers. But the long-feared threat was
at last carried out. [<a href="#B12F">12<span class="smcap smaller">F</span></a>]</p>

<p>It is a strange sequence of events that on this same
camp ground and almost immediately after the Great
Revival, one of the Harpes killed his own child in the
presence of its mother. A large maple tree still marks
the spot near which this deed was enacted.</p>

<p>The details of this murder as given today by tradition
are practically the same as those published by T. Marshall
Smith: “Big Harpe snatched it—Susan’s infant,
about nine months old—from its mother’s arms, slung
it by the heels against a large tree by the path-side, and
literally bursting its head into a dozen pieces, threw it
from him as far as his great strength enabled him, into
the woods.” This terrible tragedy is briefly referred to
by Hall and Breazeale, both of whom state that Big
Harpe, just before his death, declared he regretted none
of the many murders he had committed except “the
killing of his own child.”</p>

<p>The traditions of today and the three early writers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
just referred to are probably wrong as to the kinship
that existed between the murdered child and its murderer.
Draper, in his sketch of the Harpes, gives a
more flexible statement: “Tradition says they killed one
of their own children.” They had only three children
and all of them were born in the Danville jail. Big
Harpe’s boy, born to Betsey, and his girl, born to Susan,
lived many years, as is shown later. The child that was
so cruelly murdered by Big Harpe could have been no
other than the daughter of Sally, who had married
Little Harpe. So, in all probability, if Big Harpe
committed the crime, his brother’s child was the victim.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_6">The Harpes—Big Harpe’s Ride to Death</h2>
</div>

<p>Rumor had it that the Harpes had left the neighborhood
of Russellville, going south, and were probably
making their way to west Tennessee. In the meantime,
however, two small families had wandered into Henderson
County, Kentucky, and were living in a rented
cabin on a small farm on Canoe Creek, some eight miles
south of Red Banks or Henderson. About twenty miles
southwest of this point, near the headwaters of Highland
Creek, were Robertson’s Lick and, west of it,
Highland Lick. A few miles east of these, near the
present town of Sebree, was Knob Lick.</p>

<p>The Highland Lick road and a few trails led to these
salt licks, and, because of these roads and the salt wells
with their “salt works,” many pioneers considered
the section a very desirable one in which to live. Settlers
were constantly coming for a bushel or two of salt
and then returning home. The coming and going of
people therefore attracted less attention along the Highland
Lick road and its by-paths than in most other
sections. And since only a few months before about
fifteen outlaws had been killed in Henderson County,
and all the others had been driven out [<a href="#B124">124</a>] there was
little likelihood of undesirable persons appearing on
the scene. Principally for this reason, the two small
families of recent arrivals on Canoe Creek attracted no
particular attention, and least of all were they suspected
of being notorious criminals. A good description of
the Harpes was in wide circulation, and through General<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
Hopkins they became especially well known in
the lower Green River country. The return of the
Harpes seemed as improbable as a second bolt of lightning
in the same spot.</p>

<p>John Slover lived about a mile from the cabin rented
by the new arrivals, but had seen them only once or
twice and then from a distance. Slover’s career as an
Indian fighter in eastern Kentucky was well known to
his friends and acquaintances and was often the subject
of discussion at fireside talks. In fact, his escape from
Indian captivity was so singular and romantic that John
A. McClung devoted a whole chapter to it when, in
1832, he published his <cite>Sketches of Western Adventure</cite>.</p>

<p>One day Slover was hunting near Robertson’s Lick,
writes Draper in his “Sketch of the Harpes,” and, after
killing a bear in the woods, returned to a path leading
homeward. While leisurely riding along he heard the
snap of a gun that failed to fire. Quickly turning in
the direction of the sound he recognized his two new
neighbors, well armed and wilder looking than Indians
in battle. Comprehending the great danger of an encounter
with two fierce men apparently prepared for
murder, the experienced Indian fighter put spurs to his
horse and escaped. Slover reported this experience to
some of his friends and ventured the opinion that the
two men were the Harpes. None doubted that an unsuccessful
attempt had been made to shoot him but, on
the other hand, none agreed with him that the Harpes
had returned and were loitering around the licks.</p>

<p>A day or two later a man named Trowbridge left
Robertson’s Lick to carry some salt to a farm on the
Ohio near the mouth of Highland Creek. Trowbridge
never returned, and his disappearance remained a mystery
until a few months later when one of the Harpe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
women made known the facts. Trowbridge was killed
by the Harpes about eight miles above the mouth of
Highland Creek and his body sunk in the stream.</p>

<p>When General Hopkins received a report of Slover’s
narrow escape, although doubting the presence of the
Harpes, he detailed a number of men to watch the
place on Canoe Creek. While loitering around their
cabin the Harpes evidently not only wore clothes different
from those in which they were seen by Slover,
but also managed to change their general appearance
to such an extent that Slover, inspecting them from a
distance, did not recognize the two men as the same
who had attempted to shoot him. The women were
nowhere seen by the spies, for, as learned later, they
were waiting for the Harpes to meet them at some
designated place and time. The guards, after watching
the house about a week without results, quietly returned
to their homes, not realizing that the two suspected men
were aware of their movements.</p>

<p>The next day the Harpes started toward the hiding
place of their women and children. They traveled
south about fifteen miles to the home of James Tompkins
on Deer Creek, not far from what was then known
as Steuben’s Lick, near which place, according to one
tradition, General Steuben of Revolutionary fame was
wounded, some fifteen years before, by an Indian. They
rode good horses. Both were fairly well dressed and,
upon meeting Tompkins, represented themselves as
Methodist preachers. Their equipment aroused no
suspicion, for the country was almost an unbroken wilderness
and preachers as well as most other pioneers,
were often seen traveling well armed. Tompkins invited
them to supper, and Big Harpe, to ward off suspicion,
said a long grace at table. In the course of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
conversation one of the Harpes asked their host about
his supply of venison. Tompkins, convinced that he
was dealing with men from whom he had nothing to
fear, admitted to shooting no deer lately for the simple
reason that his powder was exhausted and had been
for some time. Big Harpe, with affected generosity,
poured a teacupful from his powder horn and presented
it to Tompkins. That same powder, as we shall
see, later performed a most singular service. [<a href="#B28">28</a>] Bidding
their host a farewell, ministerial in its pretense,
the two desperadoes, pretending to have an engagement
some miles south, took the trail in that direction.</p>

<p>That same evening, however, they made their appearance
on the farm of Squire Silas McBee, one-half
mile northwest of Tompkins’ place. Squire McBee
was a justice of the peace and had been active in fighting
outlaws. The murderers were, therefore, very
much disposed to butcher him. It was early in the evening
and the moon was shining brightly when they
approached his house. The Squire kept a half dozen
dogs for bear and deer hunting and, hearing an uproar
among them, the McBees went to the door to investigate
the cause. They saw the pack fiercely attacking
two men, but, suspecting that the intruders might be of
an unwelcome character, made no effort to restrain the
hounds. After a fierce fight with the dogs, the Harpes
withdrew.</p>

<p>Foiled in their attempt at Squire McBee’s, they proceeded
about four miles northwest and late that night
reached the house of Moses Stegall—about five miles
east of what later became the town of Dixon. Stegall
(also spelled Steigal, and various other ways) was
absent, but his wife and their only child, a boy of four
months, were at home and had, only a few hours before,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
admitted Major William Love, a surveyor, who had
come to see Stegall on business. Mrs. Stegall, expressing
an opinion that her husband would return that
night, invited him to remain. He climbed to the loft
above on a ladder on the outside of the house and was
in bed when the new arrivals entered the cabin. [<a href="#B57">57</a>]
Stegall at one time lived in Knox County, Tennessee,
[<a href="#B21">21</a>] and evidently was acquainted with the Harpes, for
Mrs. Stegall knew them but had received instructions
from the Harpes never to address them by their real
names in the presence of a third person. [<a href="#B12E">12<span class="smcap smaller">E</span></a>] Major
Love came down and met the two men, little suspecting
who they were. In the conversation that followed the
murderers themselves inquired about the Harpes and,
among other things, stated that, according to rumor,
the two outlaws were then prowling around in the
neighborhood. [<a href="#B27">27</a>]</p>

<p>Mrs. Stegall, having only the one spare bed in the
loft, was obliged to assign it to the three men. After
Major Love had fallen asleep one of the Harpes took
an axe which he always carried in his belt and, with a
single blow, dashed out the brains of the sleeping man.
The two villains then went down to Mrs. Stegall’s
room. She, knowing nothing to the contrary, presumed
Major Love was still asleep. While reprimanding her
for assigning them a bed with a man whose snoring
kept them awake, they proceeded to murder her and
her baby. After gathering some bedding and clothing,
among which was Major Love’s hat, and leaving the
three bodies in the house, they set it afire. [<a href="#B27">27</a>] It was
soon a smoking ruin.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
Such, briefly, is the account of the killing of Mrs.
Stegall as given by all writers who describe this tragedy
and as still told in western Kentucky by those who are
familiar with local traditions. Breazeale, however,
published some details which are very characteristic
of the inhumanity of the Harpes, but which are not
woven into any of the other versions. They are probably
omitted more for the reason that the accounts are
sufficiently gruesome without them than because of the
possibility that such brutality might be questioned.</p>

<p>This version has it that on the morning the two
Harpes burnt Stegall’s house, they arose and asked
Mrs. Stegall to prepare breakfast for them. She consented
to do so, explaining that since her child was not
well and she had no one to nurse it the meal would
necessarily be somewhat long in preparation. The men
then suggested that she place the baby in the cradle
and let them rock it. This she did. “After Mrs. Stegall
had prepared their breakfast and the ruthless and savage
murderers had partaken of her hospitality, she
went to the cradle to see if the child was asleep, expressing
some astonishment (as Micajah Harpe acknowledged
when he was afterward taken) that her child
should remain quiet for so great a length of time....
She beheld her tender, harmless, and helpless infant
lying breathless, with its throat cut from ear to ear....
But the relentless monsters stayed not their bloody
hands for the tears and heart-broken wailings of a bereaved
mother. They instantly dispatched her, with
the same instrument (a butcher knife) with which they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
had cut the throat of the child; then set fire to the house
and fled.” [<a href="#B21">21</a>]</p>

<p>Before leaving the Stegall farm they stole Major
Love’s horse and one belonging to Stegall. They concealed
themselves along the road that ran between Stegall’s
and McBee’s, reasoning that if the Squire saw
the light of the burning house, he would hasten there
in the morning over this road and thus easily become
their victim. While lying in wait for McBee, the outlaws
halted two men named Hudgens and Gilmore, who
were returning from Robertson’s Lick with packs of
salt. The Harpes accused them of murdering the Stegall
family and burning the house. The charge was
denied, but when the two prisoners were told they must
appear before Squire McBee to prove their innocence,
they willingly submitted to arrest. While marching
them along, Big Harpe purposely dropped behind and
shot Gilmore through the head, killing him instantly.
Hudgens, seeing this, ran away, hoping to escape, but
was overtaken by Little Harpe, who snatched from him
his gun and with it beat out his brains. [<a href="#B12L">12<span class="smcap smaller">L</span></a>]</p>

<p>The murderers then resumed their hiding place,
watching for the approach of the expected McBee. In
the meantime, John Pyles and four other men from
Christian County, returning from Robertson’s Lick,
found the Stegall house a smouldering ruin, with not a
human being in sight. Surroundings indicating that
the disaster was still unknown in the neighborhood,
they proceeded to McBee to notify him of their discovery.
They were unmolested by the Harpes, who doubtless
felt confident that the men would later return over
the same road with McBee and thus give them the
hoped for chance to shoot the justice of the peace from
ambush.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
McBee knew nothing of the fire until John Pyles
reported it. He immediately rode to the home of William
Grissom (or Grisson) who lived about a mile
north of Stegall’s. It so happened that he took a short
trail instead of the main road and thus providentially
escaped the Harpes. He and Grissom, armed and well
mounted, accompanied by Grissom’s family, rode to
the Stegall home. They not only found the house
burned to the ground, as described by John Pyles, but
also discovered in the ashes the half-burned remains of
Mrs. Stegall and Major Love. They then proceeded
to McBee’s house, fortunately taking the same short cut
over which the Squire had ridden in the morning. They
had scarcely dismounted when Moses Stegall rode up.
Then, for the first time, Stegall heard of what had happened
to his family since he left home. The necessity
of organizing a pursuing party had already been agreed
upon and Stegall was sent to Robertson’s Lick for volunteers.
[<a href="#B12M">12<span class="smcap smaller">M</span></a>]</p>

<p>That same afternoon or night the Harpes and their
women and two children, with all their goods and
horses, began their flight. The next morning Stegall
returned with John Leiper, Matthew Christian, and
Neville Lindsey. These four, with Silas McBee, William
Grissom, and James Tompkins, constituted a party
of seven daring backwoodsmen, who were prepared to
pursue and capture the Harpes, regardless of what danger
and hardship the effort might involve.</p>

<p>Then began the chase after the Harpes—a chase
made so cold and dramatic by its results, that for more
than a century every minute detail of it has been sought
by historians and by all who are curious about those full
moments when life and death look each other in the
eye with the event hanging on the balance of an instant.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
Various have been the accounts printed, nearly all
agreeing in the main features but differing in those
small details, the rendering of which seems to excite as
it satisfies the curiosity of the mind. The most accurate
account of this chase of death was published in September,
1842, in <cite>The Western Literary and Historical
Magazine</cite>. It was prepared by the distinguished historical
collector and author, Lyman C. Draper, who
rendered invaluable service to western annals by gathering
and preserving more data pertaining to the early
history of the Middle West than any other man of his
generation. His “Sketch of the Harpes” was written,
as he is careful to explain, after a long conversation
with Squire Silas McBee himself. After its publication
the narrative was submitted for correction to Squire
McBee, who made but four almost immaterial changes,
all of which are noted in the account to follow.</p>

<p>It is well at the outset to point out that Silas McBee
was a man of education and wide experience, more
competent than any of the others engaged in this whirlwind
chase to observe and give an account of all that
occurred. He was born in 1765, fought as a youth at
King’s Mountain, as he had in other Revolutionary
battles and Indian wars. He was a brave soldier, an
enthusiastic hunter, and an ideal pioneer of public
spirit and character. In Alabama he served as a member
of its first legislature. After living in western Kentucky,
where for many years he did much for the general
good, he removed to Mississippi and died there in
1845 at the age of eighty. [<a href="#B41">41</a>] One of his daughters
was the wife of Governor T. M. Tucker, of Mississippi,
and another the wife of United States Senator
Thomas H. Williams, of the same state.</p>

<p>Here is the McBee narrative of that famous chase:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
“Mounted, and equipped, and provisioned for a few
days, the little troop started about noon on their expedition
against the Harpes, leaving their women and a
faithful old negro servant with a few guns, to defend
the temporarily fortified domicil at McBee’s. The trail
of the Harpes was soon struck south of the road leading
to the Lick; and after pursuing it a few miles, a spot
was reached where the outlaws had evidently dispersed
a large drove of buffaloes, with the design, doubtless,
of so tramping down and tangling the wild grass and
shrubbery as to render it difficult, if not impossible, to
discover their course of flight. The pursuing party
understood the stratagem, and though a little puzzled
at first, they soon regained the trail, which, however,
forked off at a little distance—the party dividing, followed
each for a mile or two when the elliptical forks
again united. After this they had no difficulty in keeping
the path. At nightfall they halted and camped on
the bottom of the western shore of Pond River, a considerable
tributary of Green River. Their simple repast
despatched, and horses secured, they retired to
rest—the earth their bed, a wallet their pillow, and
their only covering the broad canopy of heaven. That
night they slept with an eye half open, but nothing
occurred, save a smart dash of rain, to require particular
notice.</p>

<p>“Early the following morning the pursuit was resumed,
fording Pond River with ease, and riding on
rapidly till an hour after sun up, when a couple of dead
dogs were found in the trail, recognized as having belonged
to the unfortunate Hutchins and Gillmore
whom the Harpes had so wantonly murdered. From
the fact that the bodies were not swollen in such hot
August weather, it was inferred that the dogs had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
long been killed, and that the fugitives could not be
far ahead. They had probably killed the dogs to prevent
their barking, and thus the better to enable them
to make good their escape. It was now proposed by
Squire McBee, in order to advance with the least noise,
that four of the most expert footmen should dismount
and push on as rapidly as due regard to caution would
permit, leaving the horses for the remaining three to
lead along more leisurely, yet keeping within hailing
distance in case of need. Leiper, Steigal, Christian,
and Lindsay, accordingly went ahead on foot, while
McBee, Grissom, and Tompkins followed with the
horses in charge. The pursuit continued in this manner
for a mile or so, when, not finding the outlaws, the
footmen again mounted their horses, and all went on
together. But a short time elapsed before Squire McBee
discovered the ruffians on a distant hill-side, a strip
of low land intervening—both on foot with guns in
hand, Big Harpe having a horse by his side, and both
holding a parley with a person on horseback [corrected
by Draper to <em>afoot</em>] whom they had apparently just
met. McBee exclaimed ‘there they are,’ pointing towards
them, and at the same time putting spurs to his
horse dashed over the low ground and made for the
spot. Big Harpe instantly mounted and darted off in
one direction, and Little Harpe on foot in another,
while the other individual rode [corrected by Draper
to <em>ran</em>] rapidly towards McBee, and when within sixty
or eighty yards suddenly dismounted [Draper eliminated
‘dismounted’] and betook himself to a tree. Seeing
this bellicose demonstration on the part of an
armed man, McBee in the excitement of the moment,
drew up his gun, loaded with two balls, and ‘blazed
away’ at that part of the body exposed to view, both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
bullets taking effect, one passing through the right
thigh, and the other the right arm. At this moment
Steigal recognised the wounded man as a settler living
up Pond River some two or three miles; and perceiving
some of the rest of the party in the act of levelling
their pieces, Steigal exclaimed ‘don’t shoot, it’s George
Smith!’ The unfortunate man, who knew Squire McBee,
now calling him by name apologised for his singular
conduct by saying, that he was nearly bereft of
his senses, expecting every moment that the Harpes
would kill him, and when he <em>treed</em> he had not recovered
from his fright and was totally unfitted to perceive
the folly and madness of the act. Little Harpe,
he said, had met him with his gun in one hand, and a
kettle in the other, going after water; and made enquiries
about the settlements, speaking in an elevated tone,
evidently that his brother might hear from the camp,
not more than eighty rods distant, and come to his aid—such
at least was the effect, intentional or not, for Big
Harpe rode up and dismounted, and had been there
but a few moments when McBee and his party unexpectedly
made their appearance. Smith desired Squire
McBee to assist him home, which with pleasure he consented
to do after the Harpes were secured. He redeemed
his promise, and in time Smith recovered both
from his fright and his wounds [corrected by Draper
to read: ‘Smith hobbled home by himself and in due
time etc.’].</p>

<p>“After they broke and ran, the outlaws were instantly
out of sight. A little search enabled the pursuers to
discover the camp, which proved to be a natural room
perhaps fifteen feet square, under a shelving rock projecting
from the cliff of a ridge facing the south, with
a large rock directly in front, leaving but a narrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
entrance—affording altogether a very secluded and safe
retreat, susceptible of easy defence. The pursuing party
were rather cautious in approaching the camp, but
Little Harpe’s woman alone remained. When questioned
about the Harpes, she frankly said that Big
Harpe had just been there, mounted each of his women
on a good horse, and darted off in great haste. She was
asked to point out the direction they had taken, which
she readily did—the men, however, in their hurry, overlooked
the trail and returned to the camp. Squire McBee,
thinking she had purposely deceived them to gain
time for Big Harpe and his women, raised his gun and
threatened to kill her instantly if she did not give the
correct information; upon which she went and pointed
it out precisely as she had described it. After perhaps
half an hour’s delay in finding the camp and parleying
with the woman, the pursuers again proceeded with all
possible haste, bent on the destruction of Big Harpe,
and fully determined that nothing should divert them
from their purpose.</p>

<p>“Squire McBee was left to bring on the prisoner,
whom he mounted on one of the outlaw’s horses, and,
though thus encumbered, he kept nearly up with the
party. When about two miles from the camp, Big
Harpe was again discovered on a ridge a short distance
ahead, and some of the party halloed to him to stop,
upon which he abandoned his women to their fate, and
dashed on alone—Leiper, in the meantime, making an
ineffectual shot at the fugitive. Tompkins and Lindsey
were left in charge of the two captured women, while
Leiper, Christian, Grisson, and Steigal renewed the
chase with increased animation. Leiper not being able
to draw his ramrod, owing to its swollen condition from
the rain of the preceding night, had exchanged guns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
with Tompkins. The fleeing outlaw was closely pressed,
Christian, Steigal, and Grisson each giving him a shot
in the pursuit—Christian’s alone taking effect, wounding
him in the leg. Harpe, discovering that Leiper was
considerably in advance of the others, and supposing
his gun empty, concluded to take advantage, as he
thought, of the circumstance, and get a fair shot at his
dangerous adversary. He accordingly stopped his
horse, and while renewing his priming, Leiper took
unerring aim, and fired—and the same powder which
the outlaws had a few days previously given Tompkins,
now sped the ball that mortally wounded Big Harpe.
Though badly shot through the spine of his back, the
wounded ruffian, determined to sell his life as dearly as
possible, levelled his gun at Leiper; but even that deserted
him in his hour of need—<em>it snapped</em>! and he
threw it away in disgust. As Leiper and Christian were
rapidly advancing upon him, Steigal and Grisson having
lagged far behind, Harpe drew a large tomahawk
and brandished it furiously to keep off his pursuers, at
the same time urging on his jaded horse as well as he
could. Leiper and Christian kept close at hand, repeatedly
calling upon him to surrender, when he would
again brandish his tomahawk in savage defiance. He
finally agreed to surrender himself if they would stop
their horses; accordingly they all reined up, Leiper and
Christian dismounted and made some demonstrations
towards loading; perceiving which, Harpe suddenly
dashed off. Leiper’s horse, which had been standing by
his side, though not held by him, now took fright and
darted off after Harpe’s horse. Seeing the accident,
Christian instantly mounted his steed and quickly overtook
the runaway horse, returned him to Leiper, and
both without loading renewed the pursuit. They easily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
followed the trail through a small canebrake of thick
growth, and just as the fugitive was emerging from it
they overhauled him, not more than half a mile distant
from where he had taken French leave. His horse was
walking quite leisurely, and Harpe’s wonted daring and
bravery seemed to have forsaken him; and, faint from
the loss of blood, he had either lost his tomahawk or
thrown it away. They rode up and pulled him from
his horse without resistance.</p>

<p>“Just at this moment Squire McBee came up with
his prisoner in charge; and Steigal and Grisson soon
after joined the party. The dying outlaw, as he lay
stretched upon the ground, begged for water, and Leiper
took a shoe from one of Harpe’s feet, and with it
procured some for him near by. McBee now told him
that he was already dying, but they should hasten his
death; time, however, would be given him for prayer
and preparation for another world—to which he made
no reply, and appeared quite unconcerned. When asked
if he had not money concealed, he replied that he had
secreted a pair of saddle bags full in the woods on an
eastern branch of Pond River, some twenty miles from
its mouth. From his description of the branch, and
their knowledge of the country, they concluded that
there was no such water-course, and gave little or no
heed to his story; but a report, however, has gained
some currency—for the truth of which we cannot
vouch, that a considerable sum of specie has been found,
within a few years, near the head waters of Pond River.</p>

<p>“Steigal, after reminding Harpe how unfeelingly
he had murdered his wife and only child, drew a knife,
and exhibiting it to him, said in plain terms that he
intended to cut his head off with <em>that</em>! ‘I am,’ said the
dying outlaw faintly, ‘but a young man, but young as I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
am I feel the death-damp already upon my brow; and
before I die I could wish that old Baldwin might be
brought here, as he is the man who instigated me to the
commission of all my crimes.’ This Baldwin, a very
suspicious character, lived at Green Tree Grove, in the
then adjoining county of Livingstone, now called Caldwell;
and though subsequently tried, he was acquitted,
nothing positive being proven against him. When they
had somewhat recovered from the fatigue of the chase,
after perhaps an hour’s delay—during which Harpe lay
on the ground upon his right side, unable from weakness
to raise himself, and rapidly ebbing his life away—Steigal
stepped forward and pointed the muzzle of his
gun at the head of the expiring outlaw, who conscious
of the intention, and desirous at least of procrastinating
it dodged his head to and fro with an agility unexpected
to the beholders, manifesting pretty plainly a strong
disrelish ‘to shuffle off this mortal coil.’ Perceiving this,
Steigal observed, ‘very well, I believe I will not upon
reflection shoot him in the head, for I want to preserve
<em>that</em> as a trophy;’ and thereupon shot him in the left
side—and Harpe almost instantly expired without a
struggle or a groan. Steigal, with the knife he had so
menacingly exhibited to Harpe, now cut off the outlaw’s
head. Squire McBee had with him a wallet in
which he had brought his provisions and provender—in
one end of this, Steigal placed the severed head, and
some articles of corresponding weight in the other, and
then slung it behind him across his horse, and all commenced
their return. Thus died Big Harpe, long the
terror of the west, and his decapitated body was left in
the wilds of Muhlenberg county, as unsepulchred as
his merited death was unwept and unmourned.</p>

<p>“After the party left the scene of decapitation they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
re-joined Tompkins and Lindsay, who had been left in
charge of the two women of Big Harpe, and they all
proceeded to the camp of the outlaws, which they gave
a careful examination. Nothing of any value was discovered,
save a dollar and a half in small change pieces.
Ten horses in all were recovered and restored to their
several owners. That noble animal which Big Harpe
rode, and which had belonged to Major Love, was conveyed
to his widow, but did not long survive that terrible
ride.</p>

<p>“The head was conveyed to the cross-roads within
half a mile of Robertson’s Lick, and there placed in the
forks of a tree, where for many years it remained a revolting
object of horror. To this day the place where
that bloody trophy was deposited is known as <em>Harpe’s
Head</em>, and the public road which passes by it from the
Deer Creek settlement to the ‘Lick,’ is still called
<em>Harpe’s Head Road</em>. In subsequent years a superstitious
old lady of the neighborhood, some member of
whose family was afflicted with fits, having been told
that the human skull pulverized, would effect a certain
cure, thus appropriated that of the memorable outlaw
of the west.”</p>

<p>The two murderers by the name of
Harps, who killed Mr. Langford last
winter in the wilderness, and were arrested
and broke the Danville goal,
killed a family on Pond river, by the
name of Staple on the 22d day of

Micajah Harp, took two of the

him, and in riding about 10 or 12
miles, caught him, having previously
shot him. He confessed the killing of
Mr. Stump on Big Barren; he also
confessed of their killing 17 or 18
besides; they killed two men near
Robertson’s Lick, the day before they
burnt Staple’s house. They had with
them eight horses and a considerable

<p><span class="smcap">Facsimile of News Item regarding Capture of
Micajah Harpe</span></p>

<p class="smaller">Dated Lexington, Kentucky, September 10, 1799, and published in the
Carolina Gazette, Charleston, S. C., October 24, 1799</p></div></div>

<p>Thus ended the career of “one of the most brutal
monsters of the human race.” And Little Harpe, having
escaped the pursuers, resumed elsewhere, as we
shall see later, his life of outlawry. The capture of
Big Harpe is briefly described by Breazeale, Collins,
Hall, and a few other historians, but none goes into
details as does Draper in the sketch quoted. Each of
these writers, however, presents some circumstance not
mentioned by the others. Some writers say Big Harpe
made a confession before he was killed; others are absolutely
silent on that feature, neither affirming nor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
denying it. Local tradition, the current newspapers,
and Breazeale are among those who state that Big
Harpe made a confession. It is more than probable
that he did. <cite>The Kentucky Gazette</cite> of September 5,
1799, prints a statement to the effect that he confessed to
killing about twenty people. Colonel G. W. Sevier,
about 1840, recalled the number as about thirty-one.
[<a href="#B12G">12<span class="smcap smaller">G</span></a>] The number of their victims noted in this sketch
up to the death of Big Harpe is twenty-eight, exclusive
of the Triswords of whom there were probably about
ten.</p>

<p>The report that Big Harpe had been captured and
beheaded and that Little Harpe had escaped spread
rapidly throughout Kentucky and Tennessee, and was
soon verified by the state press. Among the newspapers
beyond the boundaries of these two states that
announced this news was <cite>The Carolina Gazette</cite>, of
Charleston, which, in its issue of October 24, 1799, published
a paragraph on the subject, dated Lexington,
Kentucky, September 10, which is here reproduced in
facsimile.</p>

<p>History and local tradition have it that Big Harpe
was killed in Muhlenberg County, two miles west of
Unity Baptist Church [<a href="#B110">110</a>] near what has since been
known as Harpe’s Hill. An oak tree four feet in diameter,
which until 1910 stood about a hundred yards
from Pond River on the old Slab Road leading from
Harpe’s Hill to “Free Henry” Ford, was always
pointed out as the tree under which Big Harpe was
beheaded and his headless corpse lay until it was devoured
by wild animals. On the south slope of Harpe’s
Hill, about a mile and a half east of Pond River and
a few steps off the road leading to “Free Henry” Ford,
is a large isolated rock known as Harpe’s “House.” It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
was at this so-called “rock house” that the Harpes were
camping when overtaken by the pursuers. [<a href="#B109">109</a>]</p>

<p>After Big Harpe had been disposed of and the
women held as prisoners, the pursuers began their victorious
march to Robertson’s Lick, a distance of some
thirty-five miles, there to display the head and to warn
Little Harpe and all other outlaws what to expect
should they attempt any depredations. Draper, as we
have already seen, states that before the men started on
their return, Stegall placed the severed head in one end
of a wallet and some articles of corresponding weight
in the other end and then swung it across his horse. The
same historian, in one of his note books, wrote: “Big
Harpe’s wife was made to carry the head by the hair
some distance; while slinging it along she kept muttering,
‘damn the head!’” [<a href="#B12G">12<span class="smcap smaller">G</span></a>] Another account is that
the men, knowing they would be obliged to camp out
for the night and require more food than still remained,
took some roasting ears from a field along the route
and having no other means of carrying them, put them
unhusked into the bag with Big Harpe’s head. Later,
when the corn was taken out and prepared for supper,
one of the men refused to eat “because it had been put
into the bag with Harpe’s head.” [<a href="#B21">21</a>]</p>

<p>The head was carried to the neighborhood where
the two Harpes had committed their last crime. Authors
vary somewhat in the details of just how this
gruesome object was displayed as a warning to outlaws,
but all agree that it was put up by the side of the highway
(about three miles north of what later became the
town of Dixon) near the forks of the road running
south from Henderson, one branch of which extended
to Marion and Eddyville and the other to Madisonville
and Russellville, Kentucky. The old road became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
known as Harpe’s Head Road, and its successor, the
Henderson and Madisonville Pike, still bears that
name.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p>The captors had traveled about thirty-five miles before
they reached the spot decided upon as the most fitting
place to display the head. Continuing their journey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
some twenty miles further they arrived in Henderson
and there placed the three women in “the little log
dungeon, then located on the river bank near the present
bridge”—the railroad bridge erected in 1885. [<a href="#B124">124</a>]
About a week later they were taken to the court house
for trial. The minute book of the Court of Quarter
Sessions briefly shows, on pages 4 and 5, what disposition
was made of them by that court, an exact copy of
which is here given as extracted from the records in
the curious courthouse jargon of that day:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“At a Court of Quarter Sessions called and held for
the County of Henderson on Wednesday the 4th day
of September, 1799, for the examination of Susanna
Harpe, Sally Harpe, and Betsey Roberts, committed
to the jail of this county for being parties in the murder
of Mary Stegall, James Stegall an infant, and William
Love at the house of Moses Stegall in this County
and in burning his house and robbing and stealing the
horses, goods and effects of the said Moses Stegall on
the night of the 20th day of August last.</p>

<p>“Present Samuel Hopkins and Abraham Landers
Esquires.</p>

<p>“The said prisoners were set to the bar in custody of
the Sheriff of this County and being charged with the
felony aforesaid denied the fact sundry witnesses were
thereupon sworn and examined and the said prisoners
heard in their defence by their att’e on consideration
whereof it is the opinion of the Court that the said prisoners
are guilty of the facts charged against them and
that they ought to be tried for the same before the
Judges of the District Court holden at Logan Courthouse
on the first day of their next October Court, and
it is therefore ordered that the said prisoners be remanded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
to the jail from whence they came there to
remain until removed by due course of law.</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>A search recently made for details regarding this
examining or preliminary trial resulted in the finding
of a bundle of papers labeled “1799,” in which were
discovered four depositions pertaining to the arrest of
the Harpe women. They were made September 4, by
the four men who on that day were put under bond to
appear at the trial in Russellville, to which place the
case was ordered for trial. These old documents substantiate
the statements made by Squire McBee to Lyman
C. Draper who wove them, with other details, into
his account of the capture of the Harpes. The depositions
show that Moses Stegall arrived at Robertson’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
Lick on August 22, 1799, to procure volunteers to join
in the chase.</p>

<p>Matthew Christian in his testimony recites that
immediately after Stegall came to Robertson’s Lick
with the news of the murder he started for Stegall’s
farm and became fully convinced that the report with
all its terrible details was true. He then proceeded to
Grissom’s house, which had been designated as a rallying
point, preparatory to going to Squire McBee’s the
following morning. Although it was not known that
Grissom’s family had left home and gone to McBee’s
to remain during the proposed pursuit, the men, nevertheless,
met at this designated place “where they tarried
all night.” Christian “found a paper fas’d to the door
of Wm. Grayson’s [Grissom’s] house, signed by Silas
Magby and directed to Moses Stegall in the following
words: ‘Come to my house without delay,’ and a jacket
hanging up at the said door supposed by the company
to belong to Major William Love. That he from there
went to Silas Magby’s in company with John Leiper,
Nevil Lindsey, and Moses Stegall, that on their way to
Magby’s he heard a gun go off which he supposed was
fired by one of the prisoners who had committed the
felony.” This note was apparently a forgery and shows
that the Harpes had planned to kill Stegall; and since
it is more than likely that the outlaws had already
started on their flight, this attempt to waylay Stegall indicates
that the Harpes must have been associated with
some accomplice living in the neighborhood, with
whom they prearranged this move.</p>

<p>Isom Sellers’ statement shows that on August 16,
four days before the Stegall fire, the three Harpe women
stopped at John Leiper’s house and inquired the
way to Moses Stegall’s and that Sellers “being indebted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
to Susannah Harpe one dollar gave her an order upon
Moses Stegall for the said sum which this deponent
saith that Moses Stegall has informed him he has paid
agreeable to the aforesaid order.” There is nothing to
indicate the specific purpose of this statement; however,
it is further evidence that Stegall was acquainted with
the Harpes and he may have served as a spy or messenger
for them.</p>

<p>Nevil Lindsey’s deposition gives a detail not mentioned
in any printed sketch or oral tradition: “Three
case-knives were stuck into the body of Mrs. Stegal, one
of them was buried in so deep that the fire which consumed
the house would not burn the handle.”</p>

<p>John Leiper asserts that when they “had rode about
forty-five miles they came up with Sally Harpe standing
on the ground and ... to show them the way they
had gone went with them for that purpose, that after
riding about a mile and a half they came up with Susanna
Harpe, Betsey Roberts, and Micajah Harpe,
they rode by the two women and followed Micajah
Harpe for about four miles, when this deponent overtook
and killed him.”</p>

<p>Christian’s deposition states that Big Harpe, before
he died, “asked for water and that John Leiper went to
Pond River and brought him some in a shoe.” The
depositions of both Leiper and Christian end in practically
the same words: “That the said Micajah Harpe
a little while before he expired told this deponent that
Susannah was his wife and that he wished she could
come up and wished her to do better in the future and
that the whole of them would do better in the future,
escrowed as he was, and that he would acquaint her
with one thing that was hid.”</p>

<p>Two days after their examining or preliminary trial,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
the three women and two infants were sent, by order of
Judge Samuel Hopkins, to Russellville, Logan County,
there to appear before the judges of the District Court,
which court at that time embraced Henderson County.
There is no history or tradition as to how the three women
were conducted to “Logan Courthouse.” They
probably were taken on horseback. The minutes of the
next term of the court of Quarter Sessions held in Henderson
contain a few items that throw some light on
the expense of holding and then transferring the prisoners,
the total being $281.78.</p>

<p>These entries indicate that the prisoners were accompanied
by the sheriff and five guards and that the
county attorney and county clerk took part in the second
trial. The prisoners and their guard left Henderson
September 6, and after traveling the ninety-five miles,
the women were turned over to the sheriff to await their
trial, September 28.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>Major William Stewart was sheriff of Logan County
at the time. He more than once had chased the Harpes
for many a mile, only to discover that he was going in
the wrong direction and to become irritated by his
failure. He was, notwithstanding his eccentricities, a
just man and one on whom a person in need might depend,
and the three women, realizing this, must have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
felt encouraged, not only by the prospect of receiving
justice, but also of having mercy shown them. Draper,
in his notes on information supplied by George Herndon,
a Revolutionary soldier, who long lived in Logan
County, writes: “The women were, of course, in his
charge, and lodged in the old log jail, becoming dirty
and lousy, Major Stewart, feeling for their miserable
situation, agreed to let them enjoy the liberty, provided
they promised not to attempt to escape and thus make
him liable, for he did the act on his individual responsibility.
They were rejoiced at the offer and he went
around the little town and collected some necessary
articles of clothing for them, had them and their children
cleaned up, placed them in the courthouse and got
a couple of spinning wheels and set them to spinning.”
[<a href="#B12F">12<span class="smcap smaller">F</span></a>]</p>

<p>Smith says the murders committed by the Harpes in
this section of Kentucky were too fresh in the minds of
the people living in and near Russellville and the suspicion
that the women had been accomplices in their
crimes was too strong to fail to arouse a hatred for the
three women. When threats were made to tear down
the log jail and lynch the prisoners, the sheriff secretly
conveyed them into the country, where they remained
until brought back for trial.</p>

<p>This statement probably is not true. It may have
originated from the fact that Stegall and some of his
friends rode to Russellville for the purpose of killing
the women should they be acquitted. Discovering Stegall’s
motive, Stewart put the Harpe women back in
jail, pretending “it would never do to turn such characters
loose upon society,” but the next night he hid them
in a cave about five miles from town and thus shielded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
them from the revenge-seeking Stegall who, a few days
later, returned home. [<a href="#B28">28</a>]</p>

<p>An examination of the minute book of the old District
Court preserved in Russellville, shows that on
Monday, October 28, 1799, a grand jury having been
empaneled, “made the following presentment: Commonwealth
against Susanna Harpe, Sally Harpe, and
Betsey Roberts, a true bill.” A District Court was presided
over by a judge and two associate judges, and
Judges Samuel McDowell and John Allen being absent,
the women, rather than delay the trial, agreed to
be tried before the one who was present, namely, Judge
James G. Hunter. Judge Felix Grundy appeared in
behalf of the women, and no one, except the prosecuting
officer, against them. Each prisoner was tried by a
different jury, the three trials taking place on October
29th and 30th. “Susanna Harpe, late of the County
of Henderson and parish of Kentucky, spinster, who
stands indicted of felony was led to the bar in the custody
of the public jailor and pleads not guilty to the
Indictment, and for her trial hath put herself upon God
and her Country and the Attorney General in behalf of
the Commonwealth, likewise whereupon came a jury,
to-wit: [twelve men are named] who being tried ...
and having heard the evidence, upon their oaths do say
that the Susanna Harpe is not guilty of the murder
aforesaid.”</p>

<p>Then followed the trials of “Betsey Roberts, spinster,”
and “Sally Harpe, spinster,” both of whom were
found “not guilty of the murder aforesaid.” No depositions
or other records of the proceedings of these three
trials can now be found among the various old documents
still preserved in the Logan County Court House.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
The women were liberated and the act seems to have
met the approval of the public.</p>

<p>Major Stewart, in his capacity as sheriff, had many
opportunities to talk to his prisoners. Some of the incidents
in their lives could not have failed to touch the
heart of any man, especially when heard from the lips
of the women themselves. Forty years after the Harpe
women had been captured, an interview with him on
the subject was arranged to procure facts for publication.
From this interview we quote:</p>

<p>“Major Stewart said the women seemed grateful to
him, and related with apparent candor the story of
their lives and their connection with the Harpes. They
told him that their husbands had once been put in jail
in Knoxville, Tennessee, upon suspicion of crime, when
they were innocent; when released, they declared war
against all mankind, and determined to murder and rob
until they were killed. They said they might have
escaped after the murder and robbery at Stegall’s, but
for the detention at the branch where Smith was shot.
Big Harpe, expecting to be pursued, proposed that the
three children be killed, that the others might flee without
that encumbrance. His two wives and brother consented
after some discussion, but the wife of Little
Harpe took her child off to the branch where she had
seen a projecting, shelving rock, under which she placed
it, and lay down at its outer side, determined to remain
and die with her child. As her husband came to the
branch to let her know they had concluded to put the
children to death, he saw Smith, the horse hunter, approaching.
He moved toward him, and sounded the
shrill whistle on his ‘charger’—the understood signal of
impending danger. Big Harpe almost in a moment
made his appearance at the branch mounted on Love’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
mare, when the firing commenced. Smith was shot
down and the Harpes fled. Big Harpe did not go directly
to the camp, but circled around it, fearing the
pursuers might already have taken it. These sudden
and unexpected events saved the lives of the children by
allowing no time for their execution. Little Harpe’s
wife and child hastily returned to the camp, when the
firing took place a little distance below the shelving
rock, and were made prisoners with the wives and children
of Big Harpe.” [<a href="#B28">28</a>]</p>

<p>The same delay that resulted in the capture and death
of Big Harpe brought about a great change in the lives
of the Harpe women. But Major Stewart, in the interview
given forty years after the women had been in his
charge, evidently was somewhat mistaken in some of the
details and in the identity of some of the characters he
recalled. There never were more than three Harpe
children and all of them were born in the Danville jail.
We have seen how the child of Little Harpe’s wife was
killed a few weeks before the women were arrested and
taken to Henderson; it is later shown what became of
Big Harpe’s children, both of whom were with their
mothers in the Russellville jail. It is quite likely that
when Big Harpe realized the pursuers were close at
hand, he proposed that the children be killed and that
then Little Harpe’s wife took the two infants and “determined
to remain and die” with them. A few weeks
before, she had seen her own child cruelly murdered by
Big Harpe, and probably had, ever since, awaited a
chance to escape from the violence and villainy of the
lives led by the Harpes. She doubtless concluded it
would be far better for her and the two infants to fall
into the hands of the pursuers than to kill the infants,
even though the killing of them would relieve the five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
Harpes of an encumbrance which they considered sufficient
to interfere with their escape. At any rate, the
desire of Little Harpe’s wife to free herself, combined
with her effort to save the two infants, exercising itself
as it did at this critical moment, delayed the attempt to
escape and resulted in the capture and killing of Big
Harpe.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_7">The Harpes—Mysteries and Fate of Survivors</h2>
</div>

<p>Big Harpe was dead, Little Harpe had vanished into
the wilderness and the women had again been spared
through public sympathy with their apparent helplessness
and misfortunes. What was to become of them
and of Little Harpe and of the seven determined men
who had run down the gigantic monster? How were
these men rewarded for their heroism? The records,
hunted down with the utmost patience, constitute a new
story in which mystery, tragedy, suspicion and pathos
all enter to bring about poetic justice. It enables us
also to get closer to these terrible personalities.</p>

<p>First as to the seven avengers. On December 16,
1799, the Kentucky Legislature passed “An Act directing
the payment of money to John Leiper and others.”
The preamble stated that “Micajah Harpe, a notorious
offender” had committed “the most unheard of murders”
and the Governor on April 22, had offered a reward
of three hundred dollars “for the apprehension of
said Harpe.” It recites its enactment because “sundry
good citizens ... were, while in the attempt to apprehend
him, reduced to the necessity of slaying him,”
and further declares by its enactment all doubt as to the
right of these men to the reward is removed. The
money was ordered paid to “John Leiper, James Tompkins,
Silas McBee, Mathew Christian, Moses Stegall,
Neville Lindsey, and William Gresham ... one hundred
of which shall be appropriated to the said John
Leiper, and the residue to be equally divided among
the others.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
The second clause shows that “Alexander M’Farling,
John M’Farling, Daniel M’Farling, and Robert White,
who from motives of public good incurred very considerable
expense and toil in the pursuit of the said
Harpe and his associates ... be allowed one hundred
and fifty dollars.” These four men probably lived near
Danville, and, as previously noted, had been appointed
by the governor to take charge of the Harpes should
they be found “in any adjacent state.”</p>

<p>Five of the men who captured and killed Big Harpe
fared well. Tompkins and Matthew Christian continued
to live in Henderson County, where they died
old and highly respected citizens. William Grissom,
about 1810, moved to southern Illinois where he continued
the life of a well-to-do farmer. Neville Lindsey
was identified with the development of west Tennessee.
Squire Silas McBee opened up a plantation in
Pontotoc County, Mississippi, and ranked among the
best and most prominent men in that state. It was there,
in 1841, he met the historian Draper, to whom he supplied
much data relative to King’s Mountain and also
the facts used for his “Sketch of the Harpes.”</p>

<p>As for Stegall and Leiper, the immediate executioners
of Big Harpe, no sooner had they sprung into
public notice by reason of their acts, than they were
enveloped in a mystery of suspicion almost as deep as
that surrounding the Harpes themselves. It has grown
deeper with time, though their deaths within eight
years after the tragedy of the death chase rendered the
suspicion more sinister and seemed to confirm it.</p>

<p>It appears that John Leiper had not only seen the
Harpes before he joined the band in the chase, but was
strongly suspected of having been secretly involved in
some of their crimes committed in central Kentucky.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
In April, 1799, when Colonel Trabue’s boy was killed
by the Harpes, “Leiper then resided in Adair County
and knew the Trabue family well.” [<a href="#B12E">12<span class="smcap smaller">E</span></a>] He probably
lived near “old Mr. Roberts,” the father-in-law of Big
Harpe, who then had a farm in that part of Adair
County which, in 1825, became a part of Russell County.
Hypocrite that he was, in all likelihood, he joined
some of the men who had gone out to hunt the murderer
of John Trabue. For some reason he left that section
shortly after the Harpes appeared on the scene. He
may have feared that the two outlaws had planned to
establish themselves near “old man Roberts” and therefore
went to Henderson County, where he was least
likely to see them again, and so escape any vengeance
they might see fit to execute upon him for joining the
posse. Thus, not to begin a better life but to escape
death, he left Adair County for parts unknown. On
July 3, of the same year, the Henderson County grand
jury found an indictment against him for “living in
adultery with Ann L. Allen, from the 20th day of last
May.”</p>

<p>When Leiper was asked to join in the Harpe chase it
was observed that he hesitated, saying he had no proper
horse for such work, but that if Captain Robert Robertson’s
could be procured, he would go. When such arrangement
was made, Leiper boastingly declared that
if he got sight of either of the Harpes he “would stick
to the chase until he killed them or they killed him.”
Later, when Leiper and Christian overtook Big Harpe,
shortly before he was killed, the outlaw called to Leiper,
“I told you to stay back or I’d kill you,” and Leiper
replied, “My business with you is for one or the other
of us to be killed.” These and other remarks, as later
interpreted by the other pursuers, indicated that more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
than a casual acquaintance existed between Leiper and
the Harpes. Although applauded for taking part in
the killing of Big Harpe, and thus ridding the country
of a scourge, he was nevertheless condemned for his
motive in doing so. He “died suddenly of winter fever
some time during the winter of the cold Friday” (Friday,
February 6, 1807). Up to the day of his death he
was looked upon as a suspicious character by all his
neighbors and so, being unworthy of trust and an outcast,
lived and died friendless. [<a href="#B12E">12<span class="smcap smaller">E</span></a>]</p>

<p>Moses Stegall was at first the hero of heroes in the
returning band. He had suffered the loss of his wife,
child, and home, and it seems that fate itself had destined
him to strike the last deserved blow. He had been
regarded as a questionable character, yet no one could
trace any particular crime to him. The report of the
tragic manner in which he had put an end to Big Harpe
kept in the background, for a time, all unfavorable reports
heretofore heard. But it soon became apparent
that he, too, had a hidden motive in taking so active a
part in the pursuit of the outlaws. It was recalled that
when he discovered that Big Harpe had been wounded,
but was still able to talk, he had stepped forward and
deliberately cut off his head. This act was, at the dreadful
instant, regarded by the excited spectators as one
highly deserved as far as Harpe was concerned, but
for Stegall it was soon suspected to have been an act
whereby he could silence the tongue of a dangerously
wounded man who might still survive sufficiently to
reveal some of the lawlessness in which Stegall himself
was implicated. That this was his motive is verified by
a number of authorities. Draper, after a conversation
with General Thomas Love, of Tennessee, who was a
cousin of Major William Love, and whose wife was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
cousin of Thomas Langford, noted this: “The company,
before his arrival, had some confession from Harpe,
and Stegall was afraid he would be implicated and
wanted him out of the way, for Stegall bore a bad character.
Parson Henry says it was suspected that Stegall
purposely left his home to give the Harpes an opportunity
to kill his victims.” [<a href="#B12E">12<span class="smcap smaller">E</span></a>]</p>

<p>Forty years after Big Harpe was killed, a preacher
traveling from Lexington, Kentucky, by way of the
Henderson and Harpe’s Head Road to Mammoth
Cave, heard the tradition of the capture of Harpe as
then told in the neighborhood where Stegall lived.
Relative to Stegall’s motive, he wrote: “As for Stegall,
he never bore a good character and his excessive zeal
and forwardness created new suspicions against him as
being an accomplice of Harpe whom he might wish
effectually to prevent from betraying him by a precipitate
death under colour of vengeance.” [<a href="#B38">38</a>]</p>

<p>Governor John Reynolds, in his comments on the
notoriety of some of the settlers who, in pioneer days,
lived in Illinois near Ford’s Ferry and Cave-in-Rock,
pictures the last scene in Stegall’s life: “In 1806, at the
place, ten miles from the Ohio, where Potts resided afterwards,
on the road west of the river, a bloody tragedy
was acted. A man named Stegall—the same who assisted
to kill one of the Harpes in Kentucky—eloped
with a young girl and made the above place his residence....
Two or three brothers of the seduced girl,
and her father, followed them from Trade Water, Kentucky,
the residence of the father.... They found
Stegall and the others sitting up under a gallery outside
of the cabin, with a lamp burning. The assailing party
advanced in silence and secrecy, near Stegall, and shot
him without doing any of the others any injury whatever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
... and brought back the deluded girl to her
home and family.” [<a href="#B102">102</a>]</p>

<p>Thus within about a half dozen years after Stegall
and Leiper helped to capture Big Harpe they had
passed into the Great Beyond. Tradition insists that
but for the persistence of these two men, the other five
would have abandoned the hunt for the Harpes—as
many others had done elsewhere—and both outlaws, in
all probability, would have escaped to add more
crimes to their long list.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>Such is the story of the Harpes and their principal
crimes. No doubt regarding these crimes existed in
the various localities. How many similar deeds they
actually committed will never be discovered, for in the
sparsely settled country isolated settlers could, and often
did, disappear without leaving any trace of their fate
and in many instances travelers who were killed were
missed by no one.</p>

<p>There also hangs somewhat of a veil of personal
mystery over these criminals. Who were the Harpes
and what sort of men were they in appearance and
bearing? Who were the three women that, from
choice or because of terror of their mates, lived through
such terrible experience with them, bore children to
them and so became forever linked with the history of
these horrible outlaws?</p>

<p>Whether or not the two Harpes were brothers and
the two “wives” of Big Harpe sisters, is, after all, a
question that is not definitely settled by any authoritative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
record or direct testimony that has yet been produced.
At this date it seems unlikely that any further
proof of their origin, names or relationship will ever
be discovered. When they were active it was necessary
to their safety to assume various false names. They
changed clothing to such an extent as they could, in
order to avoid pursuit and capture, as well as to avoid
suspicion among those they might later approach as
intended victims.</p>

<p>They certainly seem to have been brothers in crime
and brutality; but were they brothers by birth? The
supposed wife and the “supplementary” wife of Big
Harpe were, in the same degree, sisters in their toleration
of his crimes, but were they actually sisters
through one sire? Throughout the story the view has
been taken that the two men were brothers and the two
women sisters, for such was the prevailing belief. All
the contemporary and early subsequent accounts so refer
to them, except Smith, who, in his <cite>Legends of the
War of Independence</cite>, published in 1855, says the men
were first cousins. He designates Micajah or “Big”
Harpe as “William Harpe,” a son of John Harpe, and
Wiley or “Little” Harpe as “Joshua Harpe,” a son of
William Harpe, who was a brother of John Harpe.
Smith also represents Susan, the wife of Big Harpe,
as a daughter of Captain John Wood, and Betsey, Big
Harpe’s supplementary wife, as Maria Davidson, a
daughter of Captain John Davidson. Their fathers,
he says, were North Carolinians, both captains in the
Revolutionary army, but in no wise related by blood.
Concerning the two women, he says that they were abducted
by the Harpes and became their “involuntary
wives.” He ignores the fact that the two women seem
to have taken no advantage of any of the chances they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
had to escape from these villains, and is likewise apparently
ignorant of the fact that the third woman, Sally
Rice, the wife of Little Harpe, was associated with the
outlaws during their most outrageous actions. This
same writer says that “Big Harpe and Joshua Harpe”
fought at King’s Mountain in October, 1780, and were
about twenty years old at that time, whereas all other
records show the two men could not then have reached
the age of ten.</p>

<p>Smith cites no authority for his various statements,
although in the preface to his book he declares that he
obtained his materials for his pioneer day sketches by
questioning survivors of the times and the events. It is
also observed that no other writers of that time present
authority for the statements they make as to the origin
and relationships of the Harpe band.</p>

<p>Breazeale, himself a resident of Knoxville, had opportunities
to gather on the ground early recollections
of them. In 1842 he wrote that when the Harpes appeared
there in 1797 or 1798, they “professed” to have
come from Georgia, “represented” themselves to be
brothers, and “said” their name was Harpe. He is
careful to add, “whether their real name was Harpe
or not, no one knew; nor was it ever ascertained where
they had been born and brought up, or who were their
relatives.” As they soon turned out to be thieves and
were driven away from the neighborhood of Knoxville,
it is at least possible that the relationship, the name and
all else they gave out might have been assumed and
false in order to cover their tracks from a former place.
After the murder of Langford in Lincoln County in
1799, they were both indicted under the name of Roberts,
which they had evidently assumed and under
which they pleaded and were held. It may be suggested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
here that if Roberts was the true name of Big
Harpe’s two “wives,” a shrewd criminal would, it
seems, hesitate to assume it as an alias, for the name
would help identify him. After their escape from the
Danville jail the governor in his proclamation of reward
for their capture called them “Harpe alias Roberts,”
which shows that their actual names were unknown.
It is reasonable to assume that they used false
names as the necessity arose. When, in Henderson
County, they represented themselves as “preachers,”
they must have used fictitious names for the occasion.
The name of Harpe became so full of terror and their
description as “big” and “little” brothers was so broadcast,
that change of name, appearance and pretended
occupation was necessary to their safe movement. It
will later appear that Little Harpe, after his escape
from Kentucky, assumed various names, none of which
he had used before and one of which he signed under
oath to an official document.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>Having told of some of the deeds the Harpes committed,
an effort is now made to picture to the readers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
how the monsters looked who could and did commit
these crimes. The career of the Harpes was so swift
and so veiled by its criminal nature, that the opportunities
to examine in detail their appearance and manner
was very brief. “Dead men tell no tales” and since
those who saw the Harpes at their work were usually
victims, they could leave no record. Those who have
left descriptions received them from others who had had
them second hand. When the difference in observers
and conditions is considered, and when the disguises
and changes of attire and situation are allowed for, it is
surprising to find that a plausible and convincing portrait
is made of Big Harpe.</p>

<p>As already stated, Judge James Hall, in April, 1824,
published in <cite>The Port Folio</cite> a brief account of one of
the crimes committed by the Harpes, and having been
accused of having written a story “unworthy of belief,”
he published in the same magazine about a year later
an account of another of their murders and convinced
his critics and other readers that his stories of the
Harpe atrocities were true. Judge Hall evidently continued
his investigation of the Harpes, and seems to
have made a special effort to gather data relative to their
personal appearance. He realized that fiction is often a
better visualizer of persons and their acts than is formal
history. So when, in 1833, he published his romance
entitled <cite>Harpe’s Head</cite>, and later republished it under
the title of <cite>Kentucky, A Tale</cite>, his readers were given a
striking picture of the Harpes, and especially of Big
Harpe. In his preface to this romance he states that
although the tale is the “offspring of invention,” nevertheless
“two of the characters [the two Harpes] introduced
are historical and their deeds are still freshly
remembered by many of the early settlers of Kentucky.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
Their acts were, he explains “of a character too atrocious
for recital in a work of this description ...
and have therefore been merely introduced into a tale
wholly fictitious.”</p>

<p>Judge Hall’s description of Big Harpe is as follows:</p>

<p>“His appearance was too striking not to rivet attention.
In size he towered above the ordinary stature, his
frame was bony and muscular, his breast broad, his
limbs gigantic. His clothing was uncouth and shabby,
his exterior weatherbeaten and dirty, indicating continual
exposure to the elements, and pointing out this
singular person as one who dwelt far from the habitations
of men, and who mingled not in the courtesies of
civilized life. He was completely armed, with the
exception of a rifle, which seemed to have only been
laid aside for a moment, for he carried the usual powder
horn and pouch of the backwoodsman. A broad
leathern belt, drawn closely around his waist, supported
a large and a smaller knife and a tomahawk. But that
which attracted the gaze of all ... was his bold
and ferocious countenance, and its strongly marked expression
of villainy. His face, which was larger than
ordinary, exhibited the lines of ungovernable passion,
but the complexion announced that the ordinary feelings
of the human breast were extinguished, and instead
of the healthy hue which indicates the social emotions,
there was a livid, unnatural redness, resembling that of
a dried and lifeless skin. The eye was fearless and
steady, but it was also artful and audacious, glaring
upon the beholder with an unpleasant fixedness and
brilliancy, like that of a ravenous animal gloating upon
its prey and concentrating all its malignity into one
fearful glance. He wore no covering on his head, and
the natural protection of thick, coarse hair, of a fiery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
redness, uncombed and matted, gave evidence of long
exposure to the rudest visitations of the sunbeam and
the tempest. He seemed some desperate outlaw, an
unnatural enemy of his species, destitute of the nobler
sympathies of human nature, and prepared at all points
for assault or defense.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>It is a vivid, splendid sketch full-length; a portraiture
in full keeping with the idea of a super-criminal
and his crimes. In all points except one it is sustained
as to its faithfulness by the scattered fragments of
description that have come down to us from others
speaking independently. The disputed point is the
color of his hair. Instead of the “fiery redness” that
Hall has set down every other witness makes it black.
The fact quite well agreed upon that Little Harpe’s
hair was red, suggests that in this particular Hall’s
memory confounded the two. In Governor Garrard’s
proclamation offering a reward for their capture, Big
Harpe is described as being “about six feet high, of
robust make,” “built very straight,” “full fleshed in the
face,” “ill-looking downcast countenance,” “his hair
black and short but comes very much down his forehead.”
Trabue says “the big man is pale, dark, swarthy,
has bushy hair.” Breazeale says he was a “very large,
brawny-limbed, big-boned man” and “of a most vicious,
savage and ferocious countenance,” while Stewart
[<a href="#B12F">12<span class="smcap smaller">F</span></a>] reports him as “among the tallest class of men,
say six feet two to six feet four inches” and with “sunken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
black eyes, a downcast, sour look; dark hair and
high cheek bones.” As to the hair being short or long,
Draper, as already stated, recorded in one of his unpublished
note books the pungent and grim picture of Big
Harpe’s wife being compelled, after his death, to carry
his decapitated head some distance “by the hair.” There
were evidently times when the hair of both Harpes was,
by force of circumstances, long and times when it was
short during that terrible year they scoured the wilderness.
But Big Harpe’s hair was probably black or dark
and may have been curly.</p>

<p>Little Harpe seems to have passed comparatively unobserved
in the presence of his gigantic elder. Governor
Garrard’s proclamation does not even mention
Little Harpe’s height, but says he “is very meager in
his face, has short black hair, but not quite so curly as
his brother’s, he looks older, though really younger.”
His countenance was also “downcast.” Hall says he
“was smaller in size, but having the same suspicious
exterior, his countenance equally fierce and sinister.”
Breazeale passes his appearance over, while Stewart,
who probably got his account of Little Harpe from the
latter’s wife while she was in his custody, merely says
he was “somewhat under common size, had light hair,
blue eyes and a handsome look.” It may be thought
that the wife formulated that description to lead his
pursuers astray. But the Frankfort <cite>Guardian of Freedom</cite>,
of February 29, 1804, four years after Big Harpe’s
death, contained an extract “from a letter from a gentleman
in the Mississippi territory,” written January
8, 1804, in which is noted the arrest and trial of two
outlaws in Greenville, Mississippi, one of whom, although
he gave another name, “was proved to be the
villain who was known by the name of Little or Red-headed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
Harpe and who committed so many acts of
cruelty in Kentucky.” Red hair was the particular
mark of Little Harpe.</p>

<p>Curiosity as to the three women must be satisfied with
even a less personal account and description. Hall in
his <cite>Harpe’s Head</cite>, merely says of them: “Two of them
were coarse, sunburnt, and wretchedly attired and the
other somewhat more delicate and better dressed.”
Major Stewart, who had them in personal charge for
some time and saved them from being lynched, says
that Susan, Big Harpe’s first wife, was “rather tall,
rawboned, dark hair and eyes, and rather ugly,” and
was about twenty-five years old. Betsey, the “supplementary”
wife, he described as “rather handsome, light
hair and blue eyes and a perfect contrast with her sister.”
Sally, the wife of Little Harpe, he records was
“really pretty and delicate,” about twenty years old, but
he gives no word of description. It is to be assumed
that when Major Stewart saw them they had been restored
to cleanliness and decent attire. [<a href="#B12F">12<span class="smcap smaller">F</span></a>]</p>

<p>One is tempted to pause and reflect upon these three
women, all young and once innocent as other girls, who
had so swiftly ridden the “hurricane of all horrors”
with two such men, had borne them children as nomads
do traveling the desert. One had had her child
snatched from her arm by Big Harpe and seen its brains
dashed out against a tree. Yet apparently not one of
the three attempted to escape her fate, although frequently
separated and having opportunity to do so.
The normal man accustomed to normal women wonders
what they looked like and in what respect the horrors
of their experience had affected them. In the absence
of all description that curiosity cannot be gratified.</p>

<p>The two wives of Big Harpe, if they were really<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
sisters, and daughters of “old Mr. Roberts” mentioned
but once in the pitiable record, had a brother of whom
the Reverend Jacob Young, in his <cite>Autobiography of a
Pioneer</cite>, has drawn a portrait scarcely less vivid than
that which Hall drew of his ferocious brother-in-law,
Big Harpe. It is a curious sensation to gaze even upon
this brother of two such women. The wandering
preacher tells how, in 1802, he entered a cabin in
Russell County, Kentucky, where he had an appointment
to conduct religious services. While singing to a
small audience that came barefooted and bareheaded, a
man of remarkable size, who was even more poorly
clad than the others, walked into the room. Then follow
the preacher’s words:</p>

<p>“Had I not been used to seeing rough men on the
frontier of Kentucky I should have been frightened.
I looked him fully in the eyes and scanned him closely.
His hair appeared as though it had never been combed,
and made me think of old Nebuchadnezzar and his
head ‘like eagles’ feathers.’ He wore no hat; his collar
was open and his breast bare; there was neither shoe
nor moccasin on his feet. I finished my hymn, kneeled
down and prayed and took my text to preach. The
man looked for no seat, but stood erect gazing on the
preacher. Before I was half through I saw the tears
roll down his rough cheeks. I closed and told them
that on that day four weeks I would be there again. I
rode away, but could not forget the big man. I was
sure he had distinguished himself some way, which
made me anxious to find out his history. I soon found
out that he was brother-in-law to the infamous robber
Micajah Harpe, a character so well known in the history
of Kentucky. No doubt they had been together in
many a bloody affray. On my next round he joined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
the church, and soon afterward became a Christian. He
could neither read nor write. I procured him a spelling
book. His wife taught him to read, and he soon
learned to write. On my fourth round I appointed
him class leader. He trimmed off his hair, bought a
new hat, clothed himself pretty well, and became a
respectable man. I heard of him several years afterward,
and he was still holding on his heavenly way.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>But what was the ultimate fate of the Harpe women,
whether hard, commonplace or tinged with compensatory
romance? Draper in one of his note books gives
these last glimpses of them:</p>

<p>“Betsey Roberts [the supplementary wife] was married
to John Hufstetter. They lived on Colonel Anthony
Butler’s plantation [near Russellville] as a tenant,
and Mrs. Hufstetter became ‘chicken raiser’ to Mrs.
Butler. Many years ago they moved to Red River, in
Tennessee, and thence elsewhere, probably Duck River....
Her child grew up and was known as Joe
Roberts, and the last known of him he was enlisted in
the army.</p>

<p>“Susan Harpe, as she was called, also lived in a cabin
on Colonel Butler’s plantation, six miles south of Russellville,
and being industrious made a living chiefly by
weaving. Her daughter, ‘Lovey,’ grew up to womanhood—very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
pretty, common size, round features, handsome
form, black hair, rather dark skin and a dark and
sometimes bad, devilish eye. Her temper was bad at
school—always pouting and angry—no one associating
with her. Yet it is thought had Lovey Harpe, with her
beautiful form and naturally pretty appearance, been
properly brought up, under the circumstances she
would not only have been a belle, but really a fine
woman. But, soured from neglect and obloquy, it is no
wonder she threw herself away. And both herself and
her mother were finally driven from the neighborhood
for their bad character—went to Christian County on
the waters of Pond River, where Colonel Butler had a
mill—there old Susan died, and poor Lovey, destitute
and forsaken, went down the Mississippi to Pearl,
where, by this time, Colonel Butler had removed—and
with his family went to Texas....<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>“When Sally Harpe was tried, her father, Parson
Rice, was present, a man of fine, irreproachable character,
and took his prodigal daughter home near Knoxville.
It was said, and doubtless truly, that Sally was
thought a fine girl until she married Wiley Harpe. In
1820 Major Stewart was at Ford’s Ferry on the Ohio (a
few miles above Cave-in-Rock) and saw Parson Rice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
his family, Sally and her [second] husband moving to
Illinois. He did not recognize them, but thought he
knew them, particularly Sally, who eyed him closely
and, after a little, went to one side, sat down and with
her face in her hands, had a weeping spell, doubtlessly
recounting her Harpe adventures, prompted by the
presence of one of the few persons who had treated her
with civility and kindness in her wayward career. After
he left them, Major Stewart recollected hearing the old
gentleman called Rice and the identity flashed upon his
mind. Sally Harpe’s daughter had then grown to
womanhood and was a fine looking young lady.” [<a href="#B12F">12<span class="smcap smaller">F</span></a>]
The girl referred to by Stewart as Sally Harpe’s daughter
was, in all probability, not a daughter of Harpe.</p>

<p>And so vanished from the scene, swallowed up in the
events of the rapidly developing country, all the principals
in this terrible epic of pioneer days.</p>

<p>But Little Harpe’s career was not finished. He continued
the life of an outlaw and after a few years, as we
shall see, received his deserts at the hands of frontier
justice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_8">Mason—Soldier, Pirate, Highwayman</h2>
</div>

<p>In the pioneer history of the Ohio and Mississippi
valley, Samuel Mason stands as one of the shrewdest
and most resourceful of outlaws. The Harpes were
more widely known and were more terrible characters;
their notoriety was due to their great brutality. Mason
robbed along the roads and rivers solely for the purpose
of getting money; the Harpes killed men, women, and
children simply to gratify a lust for cruelty. The two
Harpes were the worst and most abnormal of their
kind, while Mason was one of the shrewdest and therefore
one of the most “successful” of bandits.</p>

<p>These three offer the criminologist a field for study
of one of the phases of pioneer life—a life that has long
been of interest from a historical standpoint. Samuel
Mason will be cited in history and criminology as a
striking example of a lawless man receiving his just
reward. In the meantime, genealogists will probably
continue to exclude this “black sheep” from his family.
An attempt was made long ago to tear his “branch”
from the family tree so that his name and those of his
children would not mar the beauty of a stem honored
with the names of famous men and women. It was
without doubt the frontier life that Samuel Mason
entered, and not the family from which he sprang that
made him what he was.</p>

<p>Mason was a most striking and interesting figure.
He had excellent birth; he had been a fighting soldier
on the western frontier in the American Revolution,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
acquitting himself with courage. It is not clear how
such a man in time of peace developed into a highwayman
and after years of outlawry came to such a terrible
death. A portion of his history is missing and probably
will always remain a mystery, but his criminal exploits
will lack the proper contrast unless his origin and
his early services as a patriot are presented.</p>

<p>He was born in Virginia about the year 1750. Thirty-five
years after his death Draper recorded in one of
his note books that “Mason was connected by ties of
consanguinity with the distinguished Mason family of
Virginia, and grew up bad from his boyhood.” [<a href="#B12H">12<span class="smcap smaller">H</span></a>]
This has been assumed in some quarters to connect him
closely with George Mason, one of the signers of the
Declaration of Independence, but there is no proof of
it. He was a captain in the American Revolution. Two
of his brothers, Thomas and Joseph, were among the
useful, honest pioneers in the West. They started with
George Rogers Clark on his expedition to Vincennes,
but “when Clark reached Louisville he scattered some
of his men among the neighboring stations of Beargrass
[near Louisville].... Of this party were ...
Thomas and Joseph Mason, brothers of Captain Samuel
Mason.” [<a href="#B12C">12<span class="smcap smaller">C</span></a>] Another brother, Isaac Mason,
married Catherine Harrison, sister of Benjamin and
William Harrison, and as early as 1770 moved from
Virginia to Pennsylvania where he became one of the
wealthiest and most influential citizens of Fayette
County. [<a href="#B76">76</a>] These three Mason brothers, like Samuel
Mason himself, were, each in a different way, products
of their environment and their times. Pioneer
times, like most other periods, produced a variety of
characters and Samuel Mason rapidly developed into a
product quite distinct from most men of his day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
It is not often that the lineage of a highwayman can
be traced back to a position so honorably distinguished
as that of an officer in the American Revolution, yet
such was Samuel Mason. After fighting for the freedom
of his country he drifted down the Ohio to western
Kentucky and the Cave-in-Rock country and there
began a wild and free career unrestrained by either
human or divine law.</p>

<p>Before taking up Mason’s military history it may be
well to recall a few facts pertaining to the American
Revolution: The first battle in that war was fought at
Lexington, Massachusetts, April 19, 1775; the surrender
of Cornwallis took place at Yorktown, Virginia,
October 19, 1781. While these and other battles between
were being fought in the colonies along the Atlantic
coast, the frontiersmen west of the Alleghenies
were engaged in the same war with the British and
their Indian allies. On June 24, 1778, George Rogers
Clark left Louisville with about one hundred and fifty
men and floated down the Ohio, passing Cave-in-Rock,
and at Fort Massac, near the mouth of the Cumberland,
began his march through Illinois; he captured
Vincennes August 1 and thus saved the west for the
American colonies. Between Vincennes and the Old
Settlements lay a vast country held, after many hard
fights, by the settlers who occupied it.</p>

<p>It was in this frontier defense of the upper Ohio
River region that Samuel Mason took part. A complete
history of his career as a Revolutionary soldier
cannot, at this late day, be compiled; but, from the few
statements regarding him that appear in printed history
and from a few old documents still extant, sufficient
evidence can be gathered to show that Mason was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
not only a soldier, but that he took a very active part in
the struggle.</p>

<p>When and where he enlisted is not known. He probably
did so in Ohio County, Virginia (now West Virginia).
In the <cite>List of the Revolutionary Soldiers of
Virginia</cite>, issued in 1912 by the Virginia State Library,
his name appears as a captain of the Ohio County
Militia. The earliest record of his military life is one
showing that in May, 1777, he pursued some Indians
who had robbed and killed a family about fifty miles
below Pittsburgh. Mason started from one of the forts
above Fort Henry, now Wheeling, West Virginia, and
“at the head of ten militia gallantly followed the murderers.”
Although he killed only one Indian he
frightened and scattered the others so badly that the
expedition was regarded a success. “This brave young
man,” says the report written a few days later, “will no
doubt meet a reward adequate to his merit.” [<a href="#B131">131</a>]</p>

<p>About two months later we find him at Grave Creek
Fort, twelve miles below Fort Henry. He started on
another Indian pursuit July 15. On the 17th he wrote
an account of this chase and forwarded it from Fort
Henry to General Edward Hand, whose headquarters
were at Pittsburgh. The original letter is in the Draper
Collection. More than a dozen documents signed by
Mason are preserved in the Draper Collection; all are
signed Samuel Mason, except one letter, dated August
12, 1777, which is signed Samuel Meason.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> The letter
of July 17, 1777, like other documents just referred to,
shows that Samuel Mason was at least sufficiently
familiar with the “three Rs” to attempt to report in his
own handwriting some of the operations of the militia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
under him. In it he describes how a number of men,
led first by Lieutenant Samuel Tomlinson and then by
himself, had gone in pursuit of Indians and returned
after two futile scouting expeditions. The suggestion
made in this letter that he and his company be transferred
to Fort Henry was carried out. [<a href="#B12J">12<span class="smcap smaller">J</span></a>]</p>

<p>Fort Henry was a comparatively old place when this
letter was written. The three Zane brothers and a
small party of emigrants had settled there in 1769. The
fort was built in 1774 and was at first called Fincastle.
In 1776 the name was changed to Fort Henry in honor
of Patrick Henry, Governor of Virginia. Up to the
latter part of August, 1777, it was not garrisoned by
regular soldiery, but its defense, like that of some of
the other frontier forts, was left to those who might
seek shelter within its walls. By 1777 it had become a
flourishing settlement with about thirty houses around
it. Scouts were employed to watch for Indians and a
warning from the men on guard made it possible for all
the inhabitants of the place to retire to the fort on a
moment’s notice.</p>

<p>General Hand, expecting an Indian attack on the
fort, ordered Captain Mason and his men to proceed
there immediately and help defend it. Captain Mason
arrived August 12, and sent a report the same day to
General Hand that he would “urge and push” the work
and expected to be fully prepared in a few days to
resist the enemy. [<a href="#B12J">12<span class="smcap smaller">J</span></a>] By the middle of the month
there were less than one hundred militia stationed at
the fort. After all preparations had been completed
the men became impatient, for there was nothing to
indicate the approach of Indians.</p>

<p>On the night of August 31 Captain Joseph Ogle,
who with twelve other men had been watching the path<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
leading to Fort Henry, came in and reported that no
signs of the enemy had been discovered. That same
night, however, four hundred Indians, led by a few
whites, succeeded in placing themselves in ambush near
the fort. They lay in two lines concealed by a corn
field. Between these lines, along a road leading through
the corn field, were stationed six Indians who could be
seen by any one entering the road from the fort, and
who were placed in that position for the purpose of
decoying some of the whites within the line. The next
morning—September 1—two men going out after some
horses walked along the road and passed some of the
concealed Indians, unaware of their presence. They
had proceeded but a few steps when, to their great surprise,
they discovered the six Indians standing not far
ahead. The two men turned and ran for the fort. One
of them was shot, but the other was permitted to escape
that he might give the alarm.</p>

<p>Mason, hearing there were only six Indians near the
fort, proceeded with fourteen men to attack them. He
soon discovered that he had been trapped by several
hundred and that retreat was impossible. All of his
men were massacred. Captain Ogle and twelve scouts,
ignorant of the strength of the enemy, rushed from the
fort expecting to rescue their comrades, but most of
them were killed in the attempt. Of the twenty-eight
soldiers who took part in this bloody battle only five
escaped, among them Captains Mason and Ogle.
Mason, after being severely wounded, concealed himself
behind a fallen tree until the Indians withdrew.
[<a href="#B140">140</a>]</p>

<p>Mason’s venture from the fort, it seems, was a daring
deed performed without consideration of its various
possible consequences. Dr. Joseph Doddridge, in one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
of his manuscripts written about 1820, says that the
garrison was too hasty in concluding that the warning
sent by General Hand was a false alarm, and further
comments that Mason’s act was another instance of the
“folly and rashness of our militia of early times.” [<a href="#B130">130</a>]</p>

<p>In the light of a knowledge of Mason’s later life, this
act of bravery, foolish though it may have been, suggests
that he then may have had in him the daring
necessary for an outlaw, whose self-assurance of success
was too great to give the possibility of failure serious
consideration.</p>

<p>Captain Mason remained at Fort Henry until the
autumn of 1779. His presence there is shown by a
score of receipts now in the Draper Collection, one of
which reads: “Fort Henry 27th April 1778 Received
fourteen Flints of Zephaniah Blackford for the Use of
my Company Given my hand. Samuel Mason Capt.”
[<a href="#B12N">12<span class="smcap smaller">N</span></a>] He was on Brodhead’s Allegheny campaign in
August and September, 1779. [<a href="#B130">130</a>] After this expedition
he retired from active service at Fort Henry and
was succeeded by Captain Benjamin Briggs. Mason
was, however, militia captain in Ohio County, Virginia,
as late as May, 1781, as his attendance at the
Courts Martial proves. [<a href="#B76">76</a>]</p>

<p>Such is, in brief, a glimpse of Mason’s military career
as gleaned from scattered records. In 1845 Draper
filed among his manuscripts a letter which states that
“Capt. Mason resided where Daniel Steenrod’s house
now is, two miles east of Wheeling, and kept a tavern
there in 1780.” [<a href="#B12M">12<span class="smcap smaller">M</span></a>] Another of his notes is to the
effect that Mason lived on Wheeling Creek at the
Narrows, and that in the spring of 1782 Indians stole
some of his negroes. He and a man named Peter Stalnaker
went in pursuit. The Indians, seeing the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
men coming, concealed themselves behind a large rock
a little above the Narrows and from that position they
shot and killed Stalnaker. Mason fled and escaped
unhurt. [<a href="#B12A">12<span class="smcap smaller">A</span></a>]</p>

<p>Captain Samuel Murphy, whom Draper interviewed
in 1846, gave the historian a number of facts pertaining
to the siege of Wheeling and in his comments on Mason
said: “Mason, many years before [i.e. before he was
wounded at Wheeling] had stolen horses from Colonel
Hite [in Frederick County, Virginia] was pursued
and overtaken, and Mason wounded and the horses recovered.
Mason’s brother, Colonel Isaac Mason, was
a very respectable man. When Mason subsequently
turned robber, he would give the up-country people a
sufficient sum of money to take them home.” [<a href="#B12B">12<span class="smcap smaller">B</span></a>]
In <cite>The Casket Magazine</cite> of July, 1834, William Darby
writes: “Well would it have been for Captain
Samuel Mason if he had fallen with his gallant companions
on the field at Wheeling.” Mason evidently
did not remain around Wheeling longer than a year or
two after the close of the Revolution. Why or when
he drifted to east Tennessee is not known.</p>

<p>What character of man Mason was when he reached
the prime of life can be gathered from an unpublished
paragraph written by Draper about 1840, after an interview
with Colonel G. W. Sevier: “He first took possession,
without leave or license, of some unoccupied cabins
belonging to General John Sevier in Washington
County, east Tennessee, with several worthless louts
around him; one was named Barrow. Mason and his
party were not known to work and were soon charged
with stealing from negro cabins on Sabbath days when
their occupants were attending church; and articles
thus stolen were found in their possession. General<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
Sevier gave notice to Mason, who had by sufferance
remained on his place, that he and his party must leave
the country within a specified time. Knowing the character
of General Sevier, that he was a man not to be
trifled with, Mason and his friends wisely took themselves
off.” [<a href="#B12H">12<span class="smcap smaller">H</span></a>]</p>

<p>We next hear of him in western Kentucky. It is
likely that one of his purposes in going to that section
of the country was to take up the land granted to him
for services rendered as a Virginia soldier in the Revolution.
When he moved west is not known. Finley
says he settled on Red River, south of Russellville, in
1781. His youngest son, as we shall see later, was born
in western Kentucky about 1787, showing that the Masons
had arrived some time during or before that year.
In 1790 a petition was circulated by the settlers in Lincoln
County, Kentucky, who were living on the Virginia
military grants between Green and Cumberland
Rivers, asking the General Assembly of Virginia to
establish a county south of Green River. As a result,
two years later, all western Kentucky was formed into
a new county called Logan. This petition was signed
by one hundred and fifteen men, among them Samuel
Mason and one named Thomas Mason, who may have
been the eldest son of, or one of the brothers of, Captain
Samuel Mason. Inasmuch as its signers, as far as
is known, were “respectable citizens,” it is likely that
Mason was considered such when he signed, either because
he tried to be one or because he succeeded in passing
as such.</p>

<p>The petition recites: “That your Petitioners find
themselves sensibly aggrieved by their distance from
Courts of Justice, it being near two hundred miles from
this settlement to Lincoln Court House, by which, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
business renders our attendance indispensably necessary,
we are frequently exposed to much danger in
traveling through an uninhabited country, being subject
to fines and other inconveniences, when from high waters,
enemies near our frontiers, or other causes, it is
impossible to attend.” [<a href="#B106">106</a>] Mason possibly did not
then dream that in the near future he himself would
become one of the worst “enemies near our frontiers”
and be regarded as one of the great dangers to which
men were exposed “in traveling through an uninhabited
country.”</p>

<p>Mason’s domestic life in the wilderness of the lower
Ohio evidently was, in the beginning, up to the standard
of the average early settler. But in the wild woods, far
away from companionship and influence of law-abiding
citizens, the best of men were subject to deterioration.
Men of education, illiterates, and all other pioneers
were alike exposed to this strong influence of frontier
life. Many men who, by their inborn nature or by their
own choice disregarded law and order, necessarily became,
by one route or another, outcasts. Mason fell and
fell fast, and became not only an outcast, but a notorious
outlaw. The only argument that can be presented in
his defense is that he was, to some extent, a peculiar
product of his times—only more “highly developed”
than contemporaneous outlaws who were products of
the same influences and environment. It should be
added in justice to Mason that, unlike the Harpes, he
was out for booty and that he personally never shed
blood unless it became absolutely necessary for his own
safety.</p>

<p>To what extent Mason had fallen by 1794 can be
gathered from an entry quoted from Benjamin Van
Cleve’s diary, made in July of that year on his return<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
to Cincinnati from Fort Massac. Van Cleve, with
Major Thomas Doyle and a number of other men, left
Fort Washington, now Cincinnati, on March 16, 1794,
with ten boats to repair Fort Massac and to supply the
place with provisions. They arrived at the fort June
12, and three weeks later some of the men, including
Van Cleve, started on their return up the river. On
July 8 they landed at Red Banks, now Henderson.
Here are the entries taken from <cite>The American Pioneer</cite>,
published in 1843:</p>

<p>“July 8. [1794] Came to Red Banks.</p>

<p>“July 9. The weather unpleasant, and the company
of soldiers disagreeable. We [four men] determined
to quit the boat and travel the residue of the way by
land. Made preparations to set off in the morning.
This place is a refuge, not for the oppressed, but for all
the horse thieves, rogues, and outlaws that have been
able to effect their escape from justice in the neighboring
states. Neither law nor gospel has been able to
reach here as yet. A commission of the peace had been
sent by Kentucky to one Mason; and an effort had been
made by the southwest territory (Tennessee) to introduce
law as it was unknown as yet to which it belonged;
but the inhabitants drove the persons away and insisted
on doing without. I inquired how they managed to
marry, and was told that the parties agreed to take each
other for husband and wife before their friends. I was
shown two cabins, with about the width of a street between
them, where two men a short time ago had exchanged
wives. An infair was given today by Mason
to a fellow named Kuykendall who had run away from
Carolina on account of crimes, and had run off with
Mason’s daughter to Diamond Island station, a few
weeks ago. The father had forbid him the house and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
threatened to take his life, but had become reconciled,
and had sent for them to come home. The parents and
friends were highly diverted at the recital of the young
couple’s ingenuity in the courtship, and laughed heartily
when the woman told it. She said she had come
down stairs after all the family had retired, having her
petticoat around her shoulders, and returned with him
through her parents’ room, with the petticoat around
both; and in the morning she brought him down in the
same manner before daylight. This Kuykendall, I was
told, always carried in his waistcoat pockets ‘devil’s
claws,’ instruments, or rather weapons, that he could
slip his fingers in, and with which he could take off the
whole side of a man’s face at one claw. We left them
holding their frolic.</p>

<p>“I afterwards heard that Kuykendall was killed by
some of the party at the close of the ball.</p>

<p>“July 10. Left Red Banks.”</p>

<p>Ministers and certain others, in pioneer days as at
present were licensed to solemnize marriages according
to the laws established by the state. But a compliance
with the church law was, in the eyes of the Masons, a
useless form. They disregarded all laws, as it suited
them. In that section of Kentucky the execution of the
laws was in the hands of Captain John Dunn, a Revolutionary
soldier who was one of the first settlers at
Henderson and who, in 1792, was appointed its first
constable. Starling in his <cite>History of Henderson County,
Kentucky</cite>, says that Captain Dunn was “the only
recognized officer of the law in all this territory” up to
September, 1796, when he was authorized to “raise
three men to act as patrol at the Red Banks.” This increase
in patrol became necessary not only because the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
number of settlers was gradually growing larger, but
also because the wild conduct of such men as Mason
made it imperative.</p>

<p>That the presence or absence of the patrol was a
matter of equal indifference to the Masons is shown by
some notes Draper received from Mrs. William Anthony,
daughter of Captain John Dunn. [<a href="#B12K">12<span class="smcap smaller">K</span></a>] In her
letter she writes that Mason and his family were among
the original settlers of Henderson County and that with
Samuel Mason were “a brother-in-law named Duff,
and perhaps a son-in-law.” Whether or not this Duff
to whom she so briefly refers was the counterfeiter Duff
is not known. She states that about 1795 Samuel Mason
requested Captain Dunn to sign “some instruments
of writing.” Captain Dunn declined to sign the paper,
saying he would have nothing to do with any such
“rascal” as he was. This refusal aroused Mason and a
few days later he and four of his men “fell upon Captain
Dunn in Henderson, drew their concealed weapons
and beat him entirely senseless and until they
thought he was certainly dead, and then threw his body
over a fence close by. But Captain Dunn unexpectedly
recovered.” Their hatred of Dunn then grew greater
than ever.</p>

<p>Shortly after Captain Dunn experienced this narrow
escape from death Hugh Knox, afterwards Judge
Knox, of Henderson, “incurring the displeasure of the
Masons, was badly beaten by them. Others fared no
better.” One day the Masons stole a negro woman and
her two children belonging to Knox and took them to
“their then quarters at the mouth of Highland Creek.”
Knox raised a party, including Captain Dunn, and
managed to regain the three negroes. Dunn’s participation
in this rescue aroused the Masons against him to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
an even greater degree. One day Thomas Mason, the
oldest son of Samuel Mason, came to Red Banks with
his rifle and threatened to kill Dunn. Mrs. Dunn, hearing
of the threat, begged Thomas Durbin, Dunn’s cousin,
who had just arrived with a flatboat going down the
river, to try to pacify young Mason and take the gun
from him. Durbin being a stranger, it was thought he
would succeed. But Durbin had little more than begun
talking to Thomas Mason and made known the object
of his interview, when Mason, without any comment,
shot him dead, and fled.</p>

<p>Mrs. Anthony in the same letter to Draper writes:
“Late in December, 1797, early on a cold morning,
Captain Dunn, accompanied by Thomas Smith, started
on horseback for Knob Lick, carrying out corn meal
and intending to bring back salt. As they were coming
near the ford on Canoe Creek, three miles below Henderson,
Captain Dunn remarked that many a time, in
former years, he dreaded the crossing of that creek on
account of the Masons, as it was so well fitted to waylay
the unwary, but now that the Masons had gone so far
below [to Cave-in-Rock] he no longer apprehended
danger from them. The words were scarcely uttered—they
were about midway the small stream—when the
crack of a rifle told too plainly that villainy yet lurked
there. Captain Dunn fell from his horse into the partly
frozen stream. Thomas Smith got but a glimpse of the
person who did the deed; he could not, in the confusion
of the moment, define his features. The wretch darted
off and Smith conveyed Dunn home, where he died in
a few hours. When asked if he knew the person who
shot him he answered that ‘it was that bad man.’ This
allusion was probably to Henry Havard, a young man
who was a friend and supposed accomplice of the Masons.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
Thus ended the life of the first constable of Red
Banks, and with this killing the work of the Masons in
Henderson County ended. And with his departure
from there, Mason’s life went from bad to worse.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>About the time Mason and his gang left Henderson
County there appeared in Red Banks and on Diamond
Island a man named May. Mrs. Anthony calls him
Isaac May, some refer to the same man as Samuel May,
but he is best known as James May. He later played a
very important part in Mason’s history. Writing of
this outlaw’s early career, Mrs. Anthony says: “May
loitered about Henderson and had a lame sister with
him—at least she passed as such and thereby excited
some remarks. At length May stole some horses and
he and his sister made off and were pursued and overtaken
at Vincennes. May was brought back to Henderson,
and the very first night after they got him there he
managed to break away and make his escape, which he
effected by making an extraordinary leap. He joined
Mason’s gang....” He joined Mason in the South
and there performed another extraordinary act of
which, as is shown later, Mrs. Anthony has more or less
to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
During the greater part of 1797 the Masons were
established at Cave-in-Rock. Their headquarters while
in and near Henderson seems to have been changed
from time to time. For a while they had a camp at the
mouth of Highland Creek, as stated by Mrs. Anthony,
but most of their time previous to 1797 was spent not
far from what now is the town of Hitesville, in Union
County, Kentucky. A small stream, tributary to Highland
Creek, on or near which the Masons lived, still
bears the name of Mason’s Creek. About twenty miles
south of this old camp is “Harpe’s Head,” where two
years later the head of Big Harpe was placed on the
end of a pole. About ten miles northeast of the Mason
Creek country is Diamond Island, where many early
pioneers going down the Ohio in flatboats became the
victims of the Masons.</p>

<p>Fortesque Cuming stopped at Diamond Island May
16, 1808, about ten years after Mason had left it. Commenting
on the place, Cuming says, in his <cite>Tour to the
Western Country</cite>: “Nothing can be more beautifully
situated than this fine island.... It is owned by a Mr.
Alvis, a Scotchman, of great property in South Carolina,
who bought it about two years ago [1806] of one
Wells, the original locator. Alvis has a negro quarter,
and near one hundred and fifty acres of land cleared on
the Kentucky shore opposite the Island. This used to
be the principal haunt of banditti, from twenty to thirty
in number, amongst which the names of Harper [sic]
five Masons, and Corkendale [Kuykendall] were most
conspicuous. They attacked and plundered the passing
boats, and frequently murdered the crews and passengers.
At length the government of Kentucky sent a
detachment of militia against them. They were surprised,
and Harper, one of the Masons, and three or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
four more were shot, one in the arms of his wife, who
escaped unhurt though her husband received eleven
balls. The rest dispersed and again recruiting, became,
under Mason, the father, the terror of the road through
the wilderness between Nashville in Tennessee and the
Mississippi Territory.”</p>

<p>Cuming’s account is fairly accurate, but if by “Harper”
he refers to Big Harpe or Little Harpe, he is mistaken.
The “detachment of militia” that ran out this
band of Diamond Island outlaws could more properly
be called a “regiment” of local regulators, for there is
nothing on record to show that any state militia was ever
sent to the island. In pioneer days regulators, as a rule,
relied upon their own “military strength” and exercised
it without formal orders from “official headquarters.”</p>

<p>Diamond Island is about fourteen miles below Henderson.
It is some three miles long and a half-mile
wide, and more or less diamond shaped. In Mason’s
day it was covered with gigantic trees and luxurious
vines and presented so wonderful a scene that it attracted
early travelers who passed it. In pioneer days
it was, according to comments written by many travelers,
the most beautiful island in the Ohio. Zadok Cramer
in <cite>The Navigator</cite>, published in 1806, says it is a
“large and noble looking island.” J. Addison Richards
in his <cite>Romance of American Landscape</cite> refers to it as
“the crown-jewel in this cluster of the Ohio brilliants.”
Thomas Ashe, whose trip down the Ohio was “performed
in 1806,” goes so far as to say it is “by far the
finest in the river, and perhaps the most beautiful in
the world!” About a generation after Mason and other
outlaws abandoned it as a trap for victims, Edmund
Flagg visited the Island and found that “it is said to be
haunted.” In 1917 it was, according to one man’s idea,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
“sure ha’nted.” This once luxuriant forest island is
now a cornfield, celebrated for its wonderfully fertile
soil and for its “Diamond Island Canned Corn.” All
that is left of its former splendor is its size. Its heavy
fringe of cottonwood and willow still attracts attention
and helps repicture the Island as it was in the olden
days. The gnarled roots along the bank and the driftwood
piled here and there on the beach seem to hold
dumb the secrets of Mason and his men and the tragedies
enacted there more than a century ago.</p>

<p>Robbery and its booty were uppermost in Mason’s
mind and were the object of his every act. Nevertheless,
in selecting Cave-in-Rock, seventy miles down the
Ohio River, as his next headquarters he chanced to
choose a place, judging from the present appearance of
the landscape, that was far more picturesque than Diamond
Island. All the primeval beauty of the Island
has long ago disappeared, and some of the wild charm
of Cave-in-Rock and its surroundings has vanished
with the original forest. Flatboat pirates have come and
gone; the Ohio still flows on as majestically and as mysteriously
as ever, but all its flood of waters will never
wash away the legends of tragedies connected with the
two places.</p>

<p>Mason made Cave-in-Rock his headquarters during
the greater part of 1797. River pirates were numerous
in the old flatboat days—especially before 1811 when
the first steamboat was run from Pittsburgh to New
Orleans. Travelers were warned by those who had
made trips down the river and knew the usual methods
followed by river pirates; but with all their intended
precautions and in spite of all the instructions received
many of the inexperienced became easy prey for the
robbers. The Cave had often been used by travelers as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
a temporary stopping place and had become a well
known shelter. But the fact that it had also served as a
temporary abode for outlaws seems not to have been
widely circulated before this time. Mason recognized
in it a hiding place that offered him the shelter of a
good house and also one that was very convenient and
reasonably safe. Besides, it was peculiarly fitted for his
purpose, for its partially concealed entrance commanded
a wide view both up and down the river.</p>

<p>He also recognized the necessity of enticing his intended
victims into the Cave in an innocent manner or
by some unusual method. Mason’s reputation as an
outlaw was beginning to spread. He overcame the
obstacle of publicity by changing his name to “Wilson.”
In order to lull any suspicion he concluded to convert
the Cave into an inn and he and his family therefore
fitted it up for the purpose of accommodating guests.
On the river bank where it could be seen by those going
down the stream he raised a large sign: “Wilson’s
Liquor Vault and House for Entertainment.” And
thus it came about that Cave-in-the-Rock was transformed
into Cave-Inn-Rock and finally to Cave-in-Rock.</p>

<p>Daniel Blowe, in 1820, briefly recorded that “Mason’s
gang of robbers made Cave-in-Rock their principal
rendezvous in 1797, where they frequently plundered
or murdered the crews of boats descending the
Ohio.” Most historians who touched on the subject
after Blowe’s time publish, with equal brevity, the
same statement. Henry Howe, in his <cite>Historical Collections
of the Great West</cite>, published in 1852, says:
“Sometimes Mason plundered the descending boats
but more frequently preferred to wait and plunder the
owners of their money as they returned.” Comparatively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
few men returned north by river and it is therefore
likely that not many single boats or small flotillas
going south floated by unmolested. In this connection
Judge James Hall comments that the boats that were
permitted to pass the Cave and Hurricane Island, six
miles below, were pointed out by Mason, who on such
occasions would jokingly remark: “These people are
taking produce to market for me.” [<a href="#B61">61</a>]</p>

<p>Mason discovered that many of his men who went
south with captured boats never returned to report, and
he realized that sooner or later an attempt would be
made to capture him if he continued his work at the
Cave. He therefore decided to go south. For these
and probably other reasons he, as stated by Monette,
“deserted the Cave in the Rock on the Ohio and began
to infest the great Natchez Trace where the rich proceeds
of the river trade were the tempting prize.”</p>

<p>By what means and under what circumstances Mason
and his family moved south is not known. After leaving
Henderson County he remained longer at Cave-in-Rock
than at any other one place. His name is inseparably
associated with Cave-in-Rock, both in history and
tradition, but neither history nor tradition has preserved
an account giving the details of any definite robbery
committed by him while there. It is likely that he left
the Cave in ample time to avoid being driven out by
a body of men who had been organized by the merchants
of Pittsburgh for the purpose of trying to exterminate
him and all other river pirates. No record
of Mason’s whereabouts during 1798 and 1799 can now
be found. During these two years many robberies occurred
along the Mississippi River and along various
trails on the American side of the river from Kentucky
to New Orleans, but the guilty men were seldom captured.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
A number of these robberies, on both river and
land, were doubtless perpetrated by Mason under one
or more assumed names.</p>

<p>According to Audubon, the ornithologist, the Masons
made their headquarters for a while on Wolf Island,
in the Mississippi, twenty-five miles below the mouth
of the Ohio. About 1815, or a number of years after
Mason’s career was closed, Audubon gathered the following
about the famous outlaw’s stay on this island:</p>

<p>“The name of Mason is still familiar to many of the
navigators of the Lower Ohio and Mississippi. By dint
of industry in bad deeds, he became a notorious horse-stealer,
formed a line of worthless associates from the
eastern part of Virginia (a state greatly celebrated for
its fine breed of horses) to New Orleans, and had a
settlement on Wolf Island, not far from the confluence
of the Ohio and Mississippi, from which he issued to
stop the flatboats, and rifle them of such provisions and
other articles as he and his party needed. His depredations
became the talk of the whole western country; and
to pass Wolf Island was not less to be dreaded than to
anchor under the walls of Algiers. The horses, the
negroes, and the cargoes, his gang carried off and sold.”</p>

<p>In March, 1800, Mason appeared in New Madrid,
Missouri, then Spanish territory, and applied for a
passport. This was issued to him, as appears later, on
the recommendation of a man whom he had met casually
at Red Banks (Henderson, Kentucky) and who
was unaware of the real character of the person he
introduced. The passport not only permitted Mason
to settle on Spanish territory with the privilege of purchasing
land, but it also served as a document designating
him as a desirable citizen. When he applied for
this permit, he may have resolved to open up a farm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
and lead a respectable life. If so, the resolution to reform
was of short duration, for he made no attempt to
select a site for a permanent home. In the meantime he
carefully preserved the passport, knowing it might some
day serve, in its way, as a letter of recommendation. It
would also serve as evidence that he had taken an initial
step toward becoming a Spanish subject. Should he
confine his land operations to the American side, and
his river piracy to the waters of the Mississippi, and
make none but American citizens his victims, the
chances were he might some day find a safe and convenient
retreat in the Spanish domain west of the river.</p>

<p>During 1800 and the three years that followed, Mason
moved over the country with remarkable activity.
A report of a robbery committed by him on the Natchez
Trace, says Monette, was soon followed by an account
of another perpetrated on the Mississippi many miles
away, and vice versa. Men going down the Mississippi,
as those going down the Ohio, encountered many
troubles incidental to the running of boats. They were
always exposed to river pirates of whom Mason was
one. Among other hardships to which they were subjected
was the unrestrained authority of the Spanish,
who were then in possession of the land west of the Mississippi
and who practically controlled the navigation
of that river.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_9">Mason On the Natchez Trace</h2>
</div>

<p>Much has been written about the old Natchez Trace,
the narrow Indian trail leading from Natchez, Mississippi,
to Nashville, Tennessee, at which place travelers
took other trails leading to Illinois, Kentucky, and
Virginia. In the flatboat days many merchants who
had disposed of the goods they brought down the Ohio
and Mississippi returned north with the proceeds of
their sales by this overland route; others took the
ocean route by way of Philadelphia, back to their
homes. Many of these pioneer merchants refer to their
experience in this wilderness and many early western
travelers who rode over this old trail describe it in their
books. We shall, however, confine our glimpse of the
early days on this historic trace to the facts concerning
Mason.</p>

<p>It is more than likely that Mason had committed a
number of crimes along the Natchez Trace before he
appeared in New Madrid in March, 1800. Many
pioneers traveling over this route encountered highwaymen,
but none of them succeeded in identifying the
men by whom they had been robbed. The first record
of a case with which Mason is definitely connected is
that of a party of boatmen riding from Natchez to their
homes in Kentucky. An account of this incident is
told in <cite>Old Times in Tennessee</cite>, by Josephus C. Guild,
who received his information from John L. Swaney.
Swaney told Guild that more than fifty years before,
while carrying the mail over the old Natchez Trace,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
he frequently met Samuel Mason and talked with him.</p>

<p>Swaney began carrying the mail over this old Indian
trail about 1796 and was familiar with the route before
Mason appeared on the scene. The distance from
Nashville to Natchez he estimates at about five hundred
and fifty miles. It was, in his mail-carrying days, a
mere bridle path winding through an almost endless
wilderness. He rode it for eight years, making a round
trip every three weeks. Traveling at the rate of about
fifty-five miles a day permitted him a day’s rest at
either end of his route. He frequently met Indians
along the Trace. At Colbert’s Ferry, on the Tennessee
River, he always found the Indian ferrymen “contrary,”
for they would not cross the river for him if he got to
the landing after bed time. At the Chickasaw Agency,
about half-way between the two places, he changed
horses. The only white men he saw were the few settlers,
scattered forty or more miles apart, the occasional
traveler returning north and, now and then, Samuel
Mason and some of his band. Swaney rode a good
horse and carried with him, besides the mail (consisting
of a few letters, newspapers, and government dispatches)
a bushel of corn for his horse, provisions and
a blanket for himself, a pistol, a tin trumpet, and a
piece of flint and steel.</p>

<p>Merchants and boatmen brought their provisions and
other necessities on pack-horses or pack-mules. It was
from these that Mason captured much of the food and
most of the clothing he and his people required. These
travelers, as a rule, sewed their money in rawhides and
threw the hides in the packs with supplies. At night,
before making a fire, they hid their valuables in the
bushes some distance from the camp in the event of a
surprise at night by robbers. It was in this wilderness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
that Mason looked for and found many of his victims.
He and his band were the terror of all who traveled
through the Indian nation, except Swaney.</p>

<p>Mason frequently sought interviews with Swaney,
with whom he had many friendly chats. The outlaw
often asked what was said about him by the public. He
told Swaney that no mail-carrier need fear being molested
by him and his men, for mail was of no value to
them, and that he “did not desire to kill any man, for
money was all he was after and if he could not get it
without taking life, he certainly would shed no blood.”</p>

<p>“Among Mason’s first robberies,” continues the historian
who interviewed the mail-carrier, “was that of
a party of Kentucky boatmen returning home from
Natchez. They had camped at what was called Gum
Springs, in the Choctaw Nation. They ate supper,
and, as a matter of precaution, were putting out pickets
before retiring for the night. In going to their positions
one of the pickets stepped on one of Mason’s men,
who were hidden in the grass awaiting an opportunity
to pounce upon the boatmen. The robber thus carelessly
trod on jumped up, gave a yell, and fired off a
gun, calling upon his comrades to shoot and kill every
boatman. This was so unexpected to the Kentuckians
that they became panic stricken and ran off in the wildest
confusion, leaving everything, some even their wearing
apparel. Mason and his men went to the camp and
carried away everything.</p>

<p>“The next morning, just at daylight, Mr. Swaney
came along, and seeing the camp fires burning, rode
out, but could find no one. He was going toward
Natchez, and having met no party that morning, he
instinctively knew that something was wrong, and began
to blow his bugle. The boatmen recognized the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
familiar sound and commenced coming to Mr. Swaney,
one and two at a time. He asserted that they were the
worst scared, worst looking set of men he ever saw,
some of them having but little clothing on, and one big
fellow had only a shirt. They immediately held a sort
of council of war, and it was unanimously agreed to
follow the robbers and recapture their property. It
was an easy matter to follow their trail through the
cane and grass. Their plan was, as they had no arms,
to provide themselves with sticks and knives, and should
they overtake Mason and his men, attack them by a
vigorous charge, knocking them down right and left
with their shillelahs, and if those in front fell at the fire
of the robbers, those in the rear were to rush upon,
overpower and capture the robbers and recover their
property.</p>

<p>“They started in pursuit of the robbers under the
lead of the big Kentuckian. They had gone about a
mile when they began to find articles of clothing which
had been thrown away by the robbers. The big Kentuckian
found his pants, in the waistband of which he
had sewed four gold doubloons and, to his great joy, the
robbers had not found them. After this it was noticed
that the big Kentuckian’s valor began to fail him, and
soon he was found in the rear. The pursuit was kept
up about two miles further, when they were suddenly
hailed by Mason and his men, who were hid behind
trees, with their guns presented, and who ordered them
to go back or they would kill the last one of them. This
caused a greater stampede than that of the night before,
and the big Kentuckian out distanced the whole party
in the race back to camp. They abused the big Kentuckian
at a round rate for his want of courage, but he
only laughed at them, saying he had everything to run<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
for. But, to his credit be it said, he spent his last dollar
in procuring supplies for his comrades.”</p>

<p>Mason was an active man and this comparatively insignificant
robbery was doubtless preceded and followed
by others of greater consequence of which, however,
no written record or oral tradition now exists.
Then occurred the Baker robbery on the old Natchez
Trace—a robbery that became widely known through
the current newspapers and soon convinced the public
that Mason was an outlaw of dangerous character,
working over a large territory.</p>

<p>Colonel Joshua Baker, the victim of this famous robbery,
was a merchant living in central Kentucky. In
his day he made a number of trips south, going down
in flatboats and returning by way of the old Natchez
Trace. Colonel Baker had the misfortune to come in
contact with Mason at least once on land and once on
water, and, as is later shown, played an important part
in the activities that resulted in ending Mason’s career.</p>

<p>In the spring or summer of 1801, Colonel Baker took
several flatboats filled with produce and horses to New
Orleans. After disposing of his cargo, he set out on his
return home, accompanied by four men, each of whom
rode a horse. Besides the five riding horses there were
five pack-mules in the cavalcade loaded down with
provisions, and, among other things, the proceeds of
the sales made in New Orleans. Colonel Baker and
his men experienced no unusual trouble until they
reached the ford across what was then called Twelve
Mile Creek, but since known as Baker’s Creek. The
place is in Hindes County, Mississippi, about twenty
miles west of Jackson and near where the Battle of
Baker’s Creek was fought on January 16, 1863. There,
August 14, 1801, the Baker party was surprised by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
Samuel Mason and three of his men. A paragraph
relative to the robbery that followed was published in
<cite>The Kentucky Gazette</cite>, September 14, 1801. It is the
earliest printed record so far found of Mason’s activities
on the Natchez Trace:</p>

<p>“We are informed that on the 14th of August, about
sixty miles on this side of the Big Biopiere [Bayou
Pierre] River, Colonel Joshua Baker, a Mr. William
Baker and a Mr. Rogers of Natchez, were robbed of
their horses, traveling utensils, and about two thousand
three hundred dollars cash. It seems the company
had halted in the morning at a small, clear stream of
water in order to wash. As soon as they had dismounted
and gone to the water four men appeared, blacked,
between them and their horses and demanded the surrender
of their money and property, which they were
obliged to comply with. Mr. W. Baker was more fortunate
than his companions. A pack-horse, on which
was a considerable sum of money, being frightened at
the appearance of the robbers, ran away, and they being
in haste to escape could not pursue. Mr. W. Baker
recovered his horse [pack-mule] and money. He,
however, lost his riding horse, etc. Colonel Baker and
Mr. Rogers came to the first settlement, where they procured
assistance and immediately went in pursuit of the
villains. It is to be hoped they will be apprehended.
One of them who was described by Colonel Baker,
formerly resided at Red Banks. A brother of Colonel
Baker, our informant, obtained this information from
Mr. W. Baker, who lodged at his house [in Lexington,
Kentucky] on Thursday night last.”</p>

<p>John L. Swaney, the mail-carrier, whose reminiscences
have been drawn upon, gives some different
details of this incident. The banks at Baker’s Creek<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
are high and steep and at this crossing there was then
nothing more than a deep-cut bridle path on either
bank leading into or out of the stream. The Baker
party, after more or less difficulty, rode down to the
creek. While their horses and mules were drinking,
says Swaney, Mason and his men jumped up from
where they had concealed themselves. The victims,
realizing they had been trapped and were at the mercy
of the outlaws, surrendered. Mason made them drive
the pack-mules over to his side of the creek, where two
of his men took charge of them but permitted Baker
and his companions to keep their riding horses and
side arms. Colonel Baker then rode to Grindstone
Ford, a distance of about forty miles, and there raised
a company to pursue the outlaws.</p>

<p>They followed the trail of the robbers to Pearl River,
near Jackson, Mississippi, and there learned that
Mason had crossed the stream only a few hours before.
In the pursuing party was a man named Brokus, a
quadroon Indian. Brokus, according to Swaney,
stripped and swam down the river to ascertain, if possible,
what route Mason’s men had taken. While he
was climbing up the bank one of the robbers punched
him in the breast with a gun. Brokus thought he was
shot and, losing his grip on the sapling to which he was
holding, fell back into the river. After considerable
swimming and diving he reached the opposite shore.
Swaney ends his story of this chase by saying: “Mason
then made his appearance and notified Colonel Baker
that he would never recover his money. This seemed
to be accepted as the final arbitrament, for the pursuit
of the robbers was abandoned.”</p>

<p>A contributor to <cite>The Natchez Galaxy</cite> in 1829, in a
short article entitled “The Robber of the Wilderness,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
gives another account of how Mason made his appearance
on the banks of Pearl River and under what circumstances
Colonel Baker abandoned the chase. This
Natchez writer has it that when Colonel Baker reached
the river the pursuers took the saddles off their horses
and made preparations to rest for a few hours before
resuming the chase. The tracks made by Mason’s
horses showed that his party was much smaller than
theirs. The pursuers therefore anticipated nothing
other than an unconditional surrender. They did not
realize how quickly Mason could turn to his advantage
any condition that presented itself. How the outlaw
mastered the present situation is best told by the contributor
to <cite>The Natchez Galaxy</cite>:</p>

<p>“Those preliminaries being disposed of, two of the
party strolled to the bank of the river and, tempted by
the coolness and beauty of the stream, went in to bathe.
In the course of their gambol they crossed to the opposite
shore, where they encountered an individual
whose society, under the present circumstances, afforded
them very little satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Mason, aware that he was pursued and having ascertained
the superior force of his pursuers, determined
to effect by strategem what he could not hope to do by
open contest. The path into the forest was narrow
here and much beset with undergrowth; and he placed
his men in ambush so that by a sudden onset the party
of Colonel Baker on entering the woods would be
thrown into confusion, and thus be easily despatched or
routed. Chance, however, produced a success more
complete than any he could have anticipated. No
sooner had the two naked and unarmed men reached
the eastern shore of the Pearl, than Mason rushed upon
them before they could collect their thoughts or comprehend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
their danger. He was a hale, athletic figure,
and roughly clad in the leather shirt and leggins, common
to the Indians and hunters of the frontier.</p>

<p>“‘I am glad to see you, gentlemen,’ said he sarcastically,
‘and though our meeting did not promise to be
quite so friendly, I am just as well satisfied; my arms
and ammunition will cost less than I expected.’</p>

<p>“His prisoners were thunderstruck and totally incapable
of reply. Having placed a guard over them,
Mason walked deliberately down to the shore and
hailed the party on the opposite bank, who had witnessed
the scene, that has been detailed, in amazement
and apprehension. As he approached they instinctively
seized their arms.</p>

<p>“‘If you approach one step or raise a rifle,’ cried the
robber, ‘you may bid your friends farewell. There is
no hope for them but in your obedience. I want nothing
but security against danger to myself and party and
this I mean to have. Stack your arms and deposit your
ammunition on the beach near the water. I will send
for them. Any violence to my messenger or the least
hesitation to perform my orders will prove certain and
sudden death to your companions. Your compliance
will insure their release, and I pledge my honor as a
man to take no other advantage of my victory.’</p>

<p>“There was no alternative. The arms and ammunition
were deposited as Mason directed. Two of the
band were despatched for them, while a rifle was held
to the head of each prisoner. No resistance was attempted,
however, by Colonel Baker or his party, and
the arms were brought across. The banditti were soon
in readiness for a march; the prisoners were dismissed
with a good humored farewell; and the dreaded
Mason, true to his word, was soon lost in the depths of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
the wilderness. It is hardly necessary to say that the
pursuers, disarmed, discomfitted, and a little chapfallen
made the best of their way back to ‘the settlement’.”
[<a href="#B12L">12<span class="smcap smaller">L</span></a>]</p>

<p>Shortly after the Baker robbery John Mason, a son
of Samuel Mason, was lodged in the Natchez jail
charged with taking part in the affair. It is more than
likely that John Mason happened to be in town when
he was accused and arrested than that an officer brought
him in from the country. At any rate, he was tried,
convicted, and punished by whipping. It is possible
that he was innocent of the specific crime for which he
was punished, for he may not have been present when
the Mason band robbed Colonel Baker. About seventy
years later George Wiley, who was a mere lad at the
time this whipping occurred, wrote a sketch on
“Natchez in the Olden Times.” In it he says:</p>

<p>“The old jail, too, was the scene of the first public
disgrace to the noted Mason, who afterwards, with his
robber band, became the terror of travelers from the
Ohio River to New Orleans. Mason and his son were
brought to Natchez and lodged in jail, charged with
the robbery of a man named Baker, at a place now in
Hindes County where the road crosses a creek still
known as Baker’s Creek. They were defended at their
trial by a distinguished lawyer named Wallace. He,
after the manner so common with lawyers, went to
work to get up a public feeling in favor of his clients,
and succeeded so well that, although the Masons were
convicted, the general sentiment was that they were
innocently punished. They were both convicted and
sentenced to receive the punishment of thirty-nine
lashes and exposure in the pillory. I witnessed the
flogging and shall never forget their cries of ‘innocent’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
at every blow of the cowhide which tore the flesh from
their quivering limbs, and until the last lash was given
they shrieked the same despairing cry of ‘innocent,’
‘innocent.’ After they were released the elder Mason
said to the surrounding crowd, ‘You have witnessed our
punishment for a crime we never committed; some of
you may see me punished again but it shall be for something
worthy of punishment.’ He and his son then
shaved their heads, and stripping themselves naked,
mounted their horses and yelling like Indians, rode
through and out of the town.” [<a href="#B26">26</a>]</p>

<p>This account appears correct in all its details except
two. Samuel Mason’s son, John, was the only member
of the Mason family arrested and whipped. If, as
stated by Wiley, two men were punished on this occasion,
the other may have been a member of Samuel
Mason’s gang. The other error is in the statement
that the two prisoners were released. It is shown later
that after they were whipped they escaped from jail
by the aid of some of Mason’s men.</p>

<p>William Darby, another citizen of Natchez, in an
account published in <cite>The Casket Magazine</cite>, in 1834,
tells what occurred shortly after John Mason was
whipped: “One of the jury, whose name I omit,”
writes Darby, “made himself very conspicuous at the
trial of John Mason, wishing before the whole court
and audience, that ‘the rascal might be hung.’” By
some means Samuel Mason received a report of the
juryman’s statement. A few weeks later this same
juror, returning to Natchez from one of the settlements,
had occasion to ride over a bridle path through a heavy
canebreak. He was suddenly confronted by Samuel
Mason who stepped out of the cane, armed with a tomahawk
and rifle, and, raising the rifle, pointed it at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
surprised rider, who immediately threw up his hands.
Mason very calmly informed the juror that he had
waited for him for two days “to blow your brains out.”</p>

<p>The frightened man begged to be spared for the sake
of his wife and children. Mason replied that he, too,
had children and loved them as much as any other
father loved his own, and that this was his first chance
to extend to him the same mercy he had shown toward
his son John. Then, as if to further prepare the captive
for the worst, Mason asked: “Did John Mason
ever do you any harm? Did I myself ever do you any
injury? Did you ever hear of me committing murder,
or suffering murder to be committed?” Mason
shrewdly omitted the words, “except when necessary.”
The juror answered: “Never in my life.” “Thank
God, I have never shed blood,” declared Mason with
great earnestness, “but now, come down off your horse,
Sir. If you have anything to say to your Maker, I’ll
give you five minutes to say it.”</p>

<p>“The terrified man,” continues Darby, “sank off the
horse and fell on his knees, uttering a fervent prayer,
addressed rather to the man who stood beside him with
his gun cocked. At length, his words failed him and
he burst into a violent shower of tears. The man himself,
who afterward related the whole circumstance, and
could scarce ever do so without tears at the remembrance,
said he every moment expected death; but
Mason, regarding him with a bitter smile, swore his
life was not worth taking, wheeled around and in an
instant disappeared amongst the cane.”</p>

<p>Colonel Baker returned to Kentucky and reports of
the daring robbery on the Natchez Trace and of his
unsuccessful attempt to capture Samuel Mason were
circulated throughout the country. Monette says that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
about the time the Baker robbery occurred “the outrages
of Mason became more frequent and sanguinary”
and that “the name of Mason and his band was known
and dreaded from the morasses of the southern frontier
to the silent shades of the Tennessee River.” Mason’s
depredations must have been many, although authenticated
records of only a few specific instances are now
found.</p>

<p>It is probable a number of his victims did not survive
to tell the tale, for the wide-awake outlaw realized that
along the trails and on the river, as at Cave-in-Rock, his
greatest safety lay in the fact that “dead men tell no
tales.” Those who were permitted to survive had been
treated in such a manner that they would be more likely
to describe Mason as a shrewd robber than a cruel
murderer, and, it seems, most survivors were careful
not to condemn him too severely lest one of his “agents”
silence their tongues with a dagger. Mason usually
kept an intelligent man at Natchez to observe the character
of the outfits obtained by those preparing to
travel over the trail. Thus he often received advance
notice of the approach of travelers and information in
regard to their strength. [<a href="#B26">26</a>] As is shown later, Mason
had at least one agent, Anthony Gass, of Natchez, who
managed to dispose of the stolen goods turned over to
him. The probabilities were, as asserted by a Spanish
official, that this robber had “firm abettors” throughout
the Ohio and Mississippi valleys.</p>

<p>In those days many a traveler was never heard from
after he left home. In some instances it was because he
died a stranger in a strange land, or was murdered but
never missed except by his people far away, who had
no means of learning of his whereabouts or fate. Sooner
or later, the impression would prevail among them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
that the missing man was actually or probably killed
and robbed. And since Mason was the most widely
known among the outlaws in his day, he was usually
selected as the man at the bottom of the mystery.</p>

<p>An example of such a supposition occurs as an incident
in the life of the grandmother of W. L. Harper,
of Jefferson County, Mississippi. She lived along the
old Natchez Trace and frequently accommodated travelers
with food and shelter. On one occasion a young
Kentuckian stopped at her house and, becoming ill, was
obliged to remain several weeks. His conduct and
bearing were such that the old lady took a motherly
interest in him. Before he left “she actually quilted
all his six hundred dollars in his coat and vest, partly
to distribute his load, but chiefly to deceive the robbers
then infesting the road. She heard no more of him,
but the supposition was that he was another of Mason’s
victims.” [<a href="#B81">81</a>]</p>

<p>A few months after William C. C. Claiborne took
his seat as governor of the Mississippi Territory he
found it necessary to make an investigation of the
robberies on the Mississippi River. On February 10,
1802, he wrote to Manuel de Salcedo, the Spanish Governor
General of the Province of Louisiana, residing at
New Orleans, informing him that he had received
notice of “a daring robbery which had lately been
committed upon some citizens of the United States
who were descending the River Mississippi on their
passage to this town”—Natchez—and that it was uncertain
whether the persons guilty of this act of piracy
were Spanish subjects or American citizens.</p>

<div id="ip_193" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 38em;">
  <img src="images/i_193.jpg" width="600" height="869" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Map showing Cave-in-Rock and the Natchez Trace, 1814</span></div></div>

<p>To this the Governor General replied on February
28, saying among other things that “It is truly impossible
to determine whether the delinquents are Spaniards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
or Americans” and that he had given his officers
“the most positive orders ... to take the most
efficacious means of discovering and apprehending the
criminal or criminals that can be adopted ...
and I assure your Excellency that if the criminals are
taken they will be punished in such a manner as to
serve as an example to others.” He complained that
the people of “the States and Western Settlements ...
having the freedom and use of the navigation of the
Mississippi” came down into the Spanish territory in
great numbers, among whom are “vagabonds ...
who have fled from, or who do not, or can not return
to, the United States.” [<a href="#B113">113</a>]</p>

<p>Each governor was willing to arrest highway robbers
and river pirates on his own side of the Mississippi, but
neither could suggest to the other that if it became
necessary for any pursuing party to cross the river into
foreign territory, such pursuers might continue the
chase without a special permit. Samuel Mason evidently
understood and foresaw this condition of international
affairs. He had purposely avoided committing
crimes on the Spanish side, and now that his notoriety
would, in all probability, result in his being
hunted along the Natchez Trace, he moved to the Mississippi,
there to confine his operations to the river and
its American bank, on the very border of a comparatively
safe and easily reached land of refuge.</p>

<p>The Baker robbery was in a sense nothing more than
another link in Mason’s long chain of crimes. Colonel
Baker was not daunted by the loss of his money and his
failure to capture Mason, for the following spring he
started down the river again in a flatboat loaded with
merchandise. He supplied himself with guns, not only
to protect his boat, but also to better prepare himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
for his return home over the dangerous Trace. Some
time in April, 1802, when his boat reached a point below
Vicksburg, then known as Walnut Hills and Nogales,
he came in contact with Mason and some of his
men. Colonel Baker wrote a statement giving the details
of this attack and forwarded it to Governor Claiborne
of Mississippi. Colonel Baker’s written statement
cannot be found. Its effect, however, is shown
by the fact that upon receipt of it Governor Claiborne,
who was aware that outlaws had long infested the
frontier, more fully realized the necessity for action.
The governor sent out three official letters from the
capital of Mississippi Territory, each dated, “Town of
Washington, April 27, 1802.” [<a href="#B113">113</a>]</p>

<p>The first was written to Colonel Daniel Burnett, at
Fort Gibson, who was in command of the militia in
Claiborne County. It is here quoted in full from
Dunbar Rowland’s <cite>Official Letter Books of W. C. C.
Claiborne</cite>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright larger">
<span class="smcap">Town of Washington, April 27, 1802</span>—
</p>

<p class="in0">“Sir,—I have received information that a set of pirates
and robbers who alternately infest the Mississippi River
and the road leading from this district to Tennessee,
rendezvous at or near the Walnut Hills, in the County
of Claiborne:—a certain Samuel Mason and a man by
the name of Harp, are said to be the leaders of this
banditti:—they lately attempted in a hostile manner to
board the boat of Colo[nel] Joshua Baker, between the
mouth of Yazou River, and the Walnut Hills, but were
prevented by Colo[nel] Baker’s making a shew of arms,
and manifesting a great share of firmness. These men
must be arrested; the honor of our country, the interest
of society, and the feelings of humanity, proclaim that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
it is time to stop their career; The crimes of Harp, are
many and great, and in point of baseness, Mason is
nearly as celebrated:—While these sons of rapine and
murder are permitted to rove at large, we may expect
daily to hear of <em>outrages</em> upon the lives and properties
of our fellow citizens.</p>

<p>“The militia of your regiment not being organized,
I presume it would not be in your power, to execute
(strictly) a military order, I shall therefore only request,
that you will immediately endeavor to procure
fifteen or twenty men as volunteers, and place yourself,
or some confidential character at their head.</p>

<p>“This little force will then proceed to the Walnut
Hills, and after making the due examination and enquiry
at that place, they will examine the woods in the
neighborhood of the Mississippi as high up as Yazou;
If you should fall in with Mason and his party you will
use all the means in your power to arrest them, or any
of them, and I desire, that the person or persons arrested,
may immediately be conveyed under a strong guard
to Natchez.</p>

<p>“I hope that the honor of taking these lawless men,
will be conferred upon the citizens of your neighborhood;
should they succeed, I promise them a very generous
reward.</p>

<p>“I have written to Lieutenant Rennick upon this subject,
and it is probable, he will give you all the aid in
his power.</p>

<p>“With great respect &amp; esteem.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l1">“I am sir, your Hble—Servt:</span><br />

“<span class="smcap">William C. C. Claiborne</span>
</p>

<p class="in0">“<span class="smcap smaller">P. S.</span> For your information, I have enclosed you the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
statement made by Colo[nel] Baker to me, of the late
attempt made to rob him.</p>

<p class="sigright b0">
“W. C. C. C.</p>

<p class="p0 in0">“<span class="smcap">Colo[nel] Daniel Burnett</span>—”
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another letter was sent to Lieutenant Seymour Rennick,
who was in command of a detachment of United
States troops at Grindstone Ford on the Natchez Trace.
In it the governor referred to the attack made on
Colonel Baker’s boat and stated that “a certain Samuel
Mason and a certain Wiley Harp ... have been
in the habit of committing with impunity murders and
robberies.... I think it is probable they may be
found at or near the Walnut Hills; at that place the
wife of John Mason resides.” He suggested to this
officer that the federal government furnish Colonel
Burnett with a sergeant and twelve men.</p>

<p>The third letter was addressed “To the Officer commanding
the United States Troops near the mouth of
Bear Creek on the Tennessee River.” In it Governor
Claiborne writes that: “I have received information
that the road from this territory to Tennessee is infested
by a daring set of robbers, among them are a certain
Samuel Mason and a certain Wiley Harp ... I
hope, Sir, that if you should receive information of any
mischief being done or attempted in the wilderness you
will immediately order out a party of men, and make
the necessary exertions to arrest the offenders.”</p>

<p>The lower Mississippi valley was now aroused.
Mason had become a terror in a frontier country that
was more or less accustomed to lawlessness and bloodshed.
His robberies were current history and the
whereabouts of Wiley Harpe was a discussed but unsolved
question. A little more than two years before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
Governor Claiborne began to move toward the arrest
of Mason, the news that Big Harpe had been captured
and beheaded in Kentucky near Cave-in-Rock (Mason’s
one-time headquarters) had rapidly spread
throughout the country. With the report also had
come the warning that Little, or Wiley Harpe, had escaped
and fled south. Up to this time—April, 1802—there
was nothing to point out the actual or probable
whereabouts of the missing Harpe. No mention of
any murders committed by him appeared in the current
newspapers. Indications and hopes were that he
had left the country for good or had been killed. Governor
Claiborne probably had heard from others besides
Colonel Baker that Wiley Harpe was one of Mason’s
men. Even though he was not convinced of
Harpe’s presence on the Mississippi, he knew that by
linking the names of these two notorious outlaws together,
the public would more fully realize the desperate
character of Mason and therefore take a more active
interest in his capture.</p>

<p>As indicated in his letter to Colonel Burnett, the governor
of Mississippi Territory promised “a very generous
reward” for the capture of Samuel Mason and
Wiley Harpe. Monette says the governor “offered a
liberal reward for the robber Mason, dead or alive, and
the proclamation was widely distributed.” J. F. H.
Claiborne, in his <em>History of Mississippi</em>, states that the
proclamation was issued and a reward of two thousand
dollars was offered for the capture of Mason and
Harpe. No two historians make precisely the same
statements regarding the reward. It is more than likely
that a printed proclamation was issued, although an
effort to find a copy or reprint has been futile. The
proclamation in all probability gave, among other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
things, the facts embraced in the following statement
quoted from a letter written two years later by Governor
Claiborne to James Madison, who was then Secretary
of State at Washington: “A reward of four
hundred dollars for apprehending them was offered by
the Secretary of War, and five hundred dollars by myself,
in my character as Governor of the Territory.”</p>

<p>The extermination of Mason and his band was a matter
of serious importance to the law abiding and peace
loving citizens of the Territory. And now that a reward
of at least nine hundred dollars had been offered
and the militia directed to search for the outlaws, the
prospects of capture appeared very encouraging. It
was known that Mason and Harpe had lived in Kentucky
and at Cave-in-Rock, and it was therefore apparently
presumed that they were old and constant associates.
The two outlaws, however, may never have
met in Kentucky nor at the Cave. Whether or not
Mason the robber and Harpe the brute were in the
same band, both, nevertheless, deserved the severest
punishment that could be inflicted by a pioneer people.</p>

<p>A number of highway robbers and river pirates had
been arrested during the time Mason was working in
Mississippi, but Samuel Mason and Wiley Harpe, the
most notorious of them all, had evaded arrest. Where
were they likely to be found? As a matter of fact outlaws
camped at any place they found convenient and
well adapted for their work, but never remained long
at any one spot. It was known that Samuel Mason
had, at one time, lived about twenty miles northeast of
Natchez, near what is now Fayette. [<a href="#B81">81</a>] Shortly after
the Baker highway robbery had taken place it was discovered
that at the time of the robbery Mason’s headquarters
was near Rocky Springs, a stopping place on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
the old Natchez Trace some forty miles northeast of
Natchez and twenty miles south of Vicksburg.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p>Draper in a brief note [<a href="#B12H">12<span class="smcap smaller">H</span></a>] says Mason spent much
time at Palmyra and on Stack Island. Palmyra then,
as now, was a very small settlement on the Mississippi,
about twenty miles below Vicksburg. Stack Island,
also known as Crow’s Nest or Island No. 94, was
washed away shortly after Mason’s day, and in time
most of its traditions disappeared. It was on Stack
Island, near the mouth of Lake Providence, about
fifty-five miles below Vicksburg, that we first hear of
Mason—after organized bands began to search for him.</p>

<p>Claiborne, the historian, states that: “After the
Governor’s proclamation had been issued Mason and
his gang were closely hunted by the whites and Indians
and, having made some narrow escapes, they quit the
country and crossed the Mississippi to somewhere about
Lake Providence [Louisiana] in the then Spanish territory.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
Whether at Lake Providence (which is on
the Spanish side of the Mississippi but practically on
the river) or on the nearby Stack Island in the river,
Mason was in a position to flee easily into that part of
the great Spanish wilderness which today is northern
Louisiana and the state of Arkansas. There he could
not only conceal himself more effectually, but also live
with some confidence that the Spanish authorities would
not attempt to capture him.</p>

<p>At Stack Island Mason laid his hand upon fate.
The band robbed a traveler and found among his effects
a copy of Governor Claiborne’s proclamation.
[<a href="#B26">26</a>] Monette says that Mason read it aloud and “indulged
in much merriment on the occasion.” The
statement in the proclamation that Wiley (or Little)
Harpe, the Kentucky desperado, was a member of his
gang convinced Mason that the authorities were in
great fear of the prowess of his band and were driven
to arouse the public to terror and activity by conjuring
with the dreadful name of Harpe. Mason was feeling
good, notwithstanding the hue and cry raised by the
promise of rewards for his capture dead or alive. He
was perfectly confident of his ability to escape any
American militiamen or Mississippi posse. He could
afford to laugh at the additional incitement to his capture
contained in the declaration that he had joined
forces with Harpe.</p>

<p>Nobody can say positively that Little Harpe was at
that date a member of the band. It is more than probable
that Mason would not knowingly have permitted
Harpe to join him. The reputation of the Harpes for
brutality was sufficient to condemn them in the estimation
of even such outcasts as Mason and his men. Somewhere
in that southwest wilderness, however, Little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
Harpe was concealing himself from the fate that pursued
him. He was hiding under assumed names, not
daring to reveal his own even to the most abandoned
persons he met for fear of capture. Hunted like a wild
animal, it was necessary to lose his identity beyond the
most remote chance of discovery.</p>

<p>The question is <em>was</em> Harpe with Mason when the
latter read his name aloud and made merriment about
it? Was the headsman of fate stalking there at Mason’s
elbow, compelled to keep silence and join in the
laughter in that hour of grim jocularity? It was not
until April, 1802, that John Setton appears of record
as one of Mason’s band, was captured with him, tried
with him, and escaped with him. It was not until
almost two years later, under most dramatic circumstances,
that Setton was to be identified as Little Harpe—as
the man who brought fate home to Mason and himself
and immediately met the pitiless fate he had so
long and well deserved. All this will be shown later,
but it is one of the mysteries of history whether that
day at Stack Island Mason laughed himself out of the
fear of Governor Claiborne and committed himself
into the hands of fate in the person of Little Harpe.
There is a further doubt whether Mason ever did actually
discover that John Setton was Little Harpe.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>In May, 1802, we find Mason’s band at the mouth of
White River, about one hundred and fifty miles above<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
Stack Island. <cite>The Palladium</cite> on August 12, 1802, in
a news item dated Cincinnati, North West Territory,
July 31, says:</p>

<p>“A letter dated, Natchez, June 11, from a gentleman
who lately descended the river, contains the following
interesting intelligence: ‘We were attacked by
robbers near the mouth of White River and a breeze
springing up, prevented us from being boarded by two
pirogues, having in each six men well armed. They
hailed us from the shore, telling us they wished to purchase
some rifles, and on our refusing to land, they commenced
the pursuit. They originally consisted of
three companies, and were commanded by a person
named Mason, who has left the camp at White River,
and scours the road through the wilderness. About
two weeks ago they attacked a merchant boat and took
possession of her, after having killed one of the people
on board.’”</p>

<p>Other robberies in 1802 and in the summer and fall
of 1803 were reported, but by whom they were committed
is not stated in the current newspapers. The
one just cited, however, was without doubt some of
Mason’s work. It occurred about one hundred and
fifty miles above Stack Island and three hundred miles
above Natchez, and some three hundred miles below
New Madrid, which was then the principal town in
the Spanish territory of upper Louisiana. New Madrid
is now the county seat of New Madrid County,
Missouri. The New Madrid country was six hundred
miles from Natchez, out of the Mississippi territory
and in a field where Mason felt he could carry on his
usual activities, unhindered by the men who were pursuing
him for the nine hundred dollars reward. Mason
went up the river and had taken steps toward establishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
himself a few miles below the town of New Madrid,
in a small settlement known as Little Prairie,
when in January, 1803, he was trapped and captured.
He was arrested, not by the American officials he so
much feared, but by the Spanish authorities who suspected
that he was guilty of many of the crimes that
had been committed on their side of the Mississippi
River. The curious story of that frontier pursuit and
trial is now to be told from the French records for the
first time.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_10">Mason—Trapped and Tried</h2>
</div>

<p>The official record of the arrest of the Masons at
Little Prairie and their trial at New Madrid is still in
existence. The whereabouts of this old document has
been noted by a few historians who briefly state that
“There is in the Mississippi Department of Archives
and History a record in French of the trial of Mason
for robbery, by the military authorities of New Madrid,
dated January, 1803.” But no writer has heretofore
penetrated into this manuscript to discover what the
trial revealed or how it ended. It was found among
the papers belonging to J. F. H. Claiborne, the historian,
and is now preserved in Jackson.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p>The document covers one hundred and eighty-two
pages. Many of the leaves are badly faded. Although
the penmanship is far from good, every word, with few
exceptions, can be deciphered. It is filled with interesting
facts and equally interesting perjury. From the
beginning of legislation down through the pioneer
days humanity has ever been the same, and facts and
fabrications have been paraded together before officials
who are to pass judgment on the evidence presented.
The Mason trial is no exception to this old practice in
courts, but is rather an exaggerated instance of the
tendency, as common in the “good old days” as in our
own times.</p>

<p>The manuscript gives a complete history not only of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
the proceedings during the trial, but also of the arrests
that preceded it. It begins with the day New Madrid
officials were notified that the Masons were seen at
Little Prairie, thirty miles down the river. A clerk
then, and every day thereafter, carefully noted what
action had been taken by the pursuers and what evidence
had been gathered against the suspects, and continued
the record through all the other proceedings.</p>

<p>The commandant at New Madrid, by whom the pursuit
was ordered and before whom the captives were
tried, evidently did not understand English, which was
the only language spoken by nearly all the persons who
appeared before him. Questions and answers were
transmitted through an official interpreter.</p>

<p>There were fifteen witnesses. Eight made declarations
regarding their knowledge of Mason and his
family; the other seven were the prisoners themselves,
who testified in their own behalf. Every witness took
“an oath on the cross of his sword” to speak the truth.
In a few instances “and by the Holy Scriptures” was
added. As a witness was being heard the substance of
his statements was recorded in French and after he finished,
his testimony was read to him, transposed into
English, and he, “maintaining it contained the truth to
which nothing could be added or unsaid,” signed it as
did the presiding officials. Four of these signatures are
here reproduced in facsimile.</p>

<p>In the official document many statements and legal
phrases are often repeated; they add to its length but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
throw no new light on the subject. In the following
more or less paraphrased condensation the number of
words is greatly reduced but the substance of the original
is, in the main, retained.</p>

<p>The first entry in the old record is dated January 11,
1803. It shows that one Pierre Dapron, a citizen of
New Madrid, appeared in court and made a declaration
before three officials: the Commandant, Don Henri
Peyroux de la Coudreniere, “Captain of the Army,
Civil and Military Commander of the District of New
Madrid;” Don Pierre Antoine LaForge, “Commissioner
of Police and Officer of the Militia,” and Don
Joseph Charpentier, “Interpreter for His Majesty in
the English Language.” Dapron explained to these
officials that he had returned from Little Prairie and
considered it his duty to declare that Ignace Belan had
informed him that on his way to New Orleans with a
cargo of salt pork he had seen four persons at Little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
Prairie whom he suspected of being members of the
Mason band and although they did not attempt to rob
his boat, he felt their presence should be reported.</p>

<p>George Ruddell, a citizen of Little Prairie, appeared
before the court the same day and “told us by means of
the interpreter that a party of eight men and one woman,”
well armed and mounted, had arrived in town
about two weeks before and had taken possession of an
empty house belonging to an American citizen, Lesieur,
who had not been consulted by them nor had they
shown any passports. In the meantime, they rented a
ten-acre tract from John Ruddell and bought a cow and
sundry provisions. Among other things that aroused
the suspicion of the neighborhood was the careful manner
in which the house was guarded by the occupants.
Ruddell expressed the opinion that if this was not the
Mason band, then it was probably a part, explaining
that “since the Governor of Natchez had the militia on
the lookout for these robbers, the original crowd may
have separated into smaller groups.” He was inclined
to think that although the man called “father” was not
the exact size of Samuel Mason, whom he had seen
some years before, he nevertheless felt confident that
“father” Mason was among the members of this gang.
He concluded his declaration by stating that he was acting
in behalf of the citizens of Little Prairie who suggested
that these suspects be arrested and their effects
examined.</p>

<p>The next day, “in view of the above cited declarations,”
the Commandant ordered four persons, Joseph
Charpentier, LaForge, George Ruddell, and Don Robert
McCoy, “Captain of the Militia,” to proceed to
Little Prairie—a distance of about thirty miles—and
there meet a division of regulars commanded by Corporal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
Felipo Canot, who had been ordered to the scene.
Upon their arrival at the place further investigation
convinced the officers that the new suspects were Samuel
Mason and some of his followers, and that about half
the number had left the Lesieur house and moved over
to a house owned by Francois Langlois. Realizing that
the pursuing party would soon be scented by the suspects,
it was decided to invade the two houses early in
the morning.</p>

<p>At six o’clock in the morning George Ruddell informed
Captain McCoy that the Masons had their
horses saddled and loaded with baggage and were on
the point of leaving for New Madrid, but Samuel Mason,
known as “Father Mason,” hearing that the interpreter
was in town, expressed a desire to see him and
explain that he wished to go to New Madrid to “justify
himself” and clear himself of the crimes of which he
was “falsely accused.” Captain McCoy, George Ruddell,
and the interpreter walked to the house occupied
by Samuel Mason and suggested to him that, in view
of his intention to volunteer a justification, he and those
of his people with him would do well to go over to the
house occupied by his other associates where he would
be given a hearing and could make explanations which
would be forwarded to the Commandant at New Madrid.
To this Mason consented and by eight o’clock his
party, consisting of six men, one woman, and three children,
was assembled in the Lesieur house which, unsuspected
by the Masons, was guarded by concealed militia.
Samuel Mason, turning to Captain McCoy, immediately
referred to the “unjust imputations” made
against him and his people. The Captain expressed the
opinion that his explanation and justification had better
be made in person to the Commandant. A signal was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
given by Captain McCoy, and before the Masons realized
it, they were “in handcuffs and chains.”</p>

<p>Then, in the words of the clerk, “We immediately
asked said prisoners their names and the father or oldest
gave his as Samuel Mason;” those of his four sons, in
order of age, were given as Thomas, John, Samuel
Jr. (about eighteen years of age) and Magnus Mason
(about sixteen years of age). Another man called himself
John Taylor (later in the trial known as John Setton).
The woman had three children with her and gave
her name as Marguerite Douglas, wife of John Mason.
Upon being questioned by McCoy and Charpentier,
Samuel Mason answered that they had come from Nogales
(Vicksburg) and intended to establish themselves
in or near Little Prairie, in accordance with a passport
given him. When asked to produce a passport issued
“by the authorities of the locality from whence he
came,” it was discovered he had “none other than the
one we ourselves had given, dated New Madrid, March
29th, 1800.” This he surrendered to Captain McCoy,
who agreed with the other officials present that it was
genuine.</p>

<p class="smaller">Written in French and issued by the Spanish Commandant of the District of New Madrid,
March 29, 1800</p></div></div>

<p>The original passport was inserted between two
leaves of the record book where it has ever since remained.
The following is a translation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="in0">
“New Madrid, March 29th, 1800.
</p>

<p>“Whereas Samuel Masson, Esqr. has expressed a
wish to settle in this district and wishes to arrange his
business affairs, We, Don Henri Peyroux de la Coundreniere,
Captain of the Armies of His Majesty, Civil
and Military Commander of this Post and District of
New Madrid, hereby grant permission to said Samuel
Masson to proceed to Natchez per boat, and on his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
return from there, said Samuel Masson may select a
suitable place in this District for himself and family.
He, Samuel Masson, having by oath attested his loyalty
and fidelity to us, we pray that no hindrance be
placed to his proposed journey.</p>

<p class="sigright">“<span class="smcap">Henri Peyroux</span></p>

<p>“Approved and marked with the flourish of our signature.”</p></blockquote>

<p>“We told them,” continues the record, “in order that
none of their effects be lost or strayed an inventory of
same would be made at once ... and at two o’clock in
the afternoon we proceeded with the above-named inventory.”
This work required almost two days. Every
item was carefully examined and tabulated. There
were eight horses, new and old clothes, many yards of
silk, muslin and cotton, old and new pistols and guns,
“a field stove,” a box of salt, three horns of powder, six
barrels of flour, English cutlery, various other imported
goods and more than a hundred other items,
and seven thousand dollars in United States money of
various denominations, of which the series number and
amount of each was noted.</p>

<p>The following morning, while the inventory was
being made, Samuel Mason, on behalf of his people,
applied for the return of certain utensils and clothing
of which his people had immediate need, and asked for
“a pro and con settlement” with the citizens of Little
Prairie. These requests were granted. On the 16th,
the prisoners, with their property and a military guard,
arrived at New Madrid. How they were transported
is not stated.</p>

<p>The trial began the morning of the 17th. “The Commandant
having learned of the conversation Captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
McCoy and Charpentier had with the prisoners, called
on these two officers to make declarations.”</p>

<p>Captain McCoy, after taking the oath, declared that
his duties as captain of the militia threw him in the
presence of Samuel Mason much of the time after the
arrest, and that the prisoner frequently spoke to him of
the coming trial. Mason, continued the witness, repeatedly
asserted that he had never done any wrong on
the Spanish side of the Mississippi River, and that if
time were given him he could and would, in justice to
himself, disclose many criminals. On one occasion
Mason asked “if a man became informer, with proofs
and evidence of crimes committed in the States, could
he obtain pardon for those attributed to him?” McCoy
casually answered him that if he could give such information
it would, in all probability, clear up matters
and greatly help him and his people.</p>

<p>Mason stated to Captain McCoy that although it
was widely rumored that he was “the man smeared
over with black,” who had committed many crimes
“along the highway,” he could in each instance prove
that he was far from the scene when the robberies occurred.
He denied that he was implicated in the highway
robbery or the boat robbery of a man named Baker,
from whom “some three thousand piasters” were
taken. But when he, Captain McCoy, remarked that
Baker would appear in a few days, “the prisoner
seemed disturbed and asked for particulars relative to
his coming.”</p>

<p>Captain McCoy further declared that while the inventory
was being taken he asked Mason how he happened
to have so many banknotes and the old man who
usually stood as spokesman for his crowd, first seemed
startled and then pretended not to understand the question.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
The question was repeated and the prisoners
stared at each other for a moment, when John Taylor
(alias John Setton) came to the rescue by saying: “The
banknotes were found in a bag hanging in a bush, near
the road where we happened to be camping.”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>Don Joseph Charpentier was next called upon to
make a declaration. The record shows that his statements
were practically the same as those made by Captain
McCoy, but touched on a few additional subjects.
He had heard Samuel Mason say that the only thing
for which he could be reproached was having served in
prison for debt. Mason, he said, asked him and some
of the other officers whether or not they thought the
money found in his possession was genuine and all answered,
in effect, that they presumed Mason knew. To
this the prisoner replied that he had made no attempt
to pass any of the bills and that if they were counterfeit,
he could not be punished for carrying them. He
wanted to know by whose authority he was arrested,
and whether it was likely he would be turned over to
the Americans. He stated he would rather be deprived
of all his property and pass the remainder of his days
on Spanish soil than be delivered into the hands of the
United States officials.</p>

<p>On January 18th Samuel Mason appeared before
the Commandant, the Commissioner of Police, the Captain
of Militia, and the Interpreter. Answering questions,
he stated that he was born in Pennsylvania and
had lately come from the District of Natchez for the
purpose of residing near New Madrid. As to how he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
made a living he swore he had depended upon his plantation,
his “horned cattle,” the labor of his sons and the
people he sometimes employed. He explained that his
plan was to have his four sons then with him, his wife,
his son living on the river Monongahela, Mrs. Thompson
(a married daughter) and her husband, another
son-in-law, and a few other kinsmen join him in the
settlement he proposed to establish. He said that he
had recently sold his place near Natchez and the only
claim he had on land was located on the Monongahela,
to which he had fallen heir through a “brother who
died young.”</p>

<p>When asked why he had not made use of the passport
the year it was issued to him, he asserted that he had
been kept busy settling his business affairs. He added
that he had spent much time in the District of Natchez
trying to show that the suspicion held against him of
being a robber was groundless, but notwithstanding
earnest efforts his attempts were in vain.</p>

<p>His attention was called to the fact that since his passport
as a settler’s permit had expired, he would be
obliged to give new references. He then gave the name
of his daughter, Mrs. Thompson, of Cape Girardeau,
whose first husband was Mr. Winterington, and General
Benjamin Harrison, whose sister married his,
Samuel Mason’s, brother, the owner of a kiln on the
Monongahela. He was requested to cite, if he could,
some local people, and he referred to Dr. Richard Jones
Waters, saying he was the man on whose recommendation
he had received the passport three years before, but
admitted that he had known the gentleman only slightly.</p>

<p>Mason’s answers show that he knew more or less
about the robberies that had been referred to, but in
each case he managed to explain how and from whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
he received the information. For example, when the
Owsley boat robbery, in which he said Phillips was implicated,
was under discussion, he stated that in May,
1802, two of his sons were coming up the Mississippi
River and were overtaken by two men, Wiguens and
John Taylor, in a boat, from whom they heard of the
robbery. Later, he met Owsley, the owner of the boat,
who requested him to investigate the case. This he did,
with some assistance by a Mr. Koiret, and in consequence
he knew where the booty had been stored and
learned many other details.</p>

<p>He more than once asserted he would throw light on
a number of robberies, and not only give the names of
the guilty parties, but would produce them, “if the
Commandant assured him he would spare his life and
exonerate him of all misdeeds which rumor had so unjustly
attributed to him.” The Commandant replied
that “it is customary to spare the lives of such confessors
and to show great leniency toward them.” After a
somewhat pathetic recital before the officials of how his
many efforts ended in failure to “justify” himself, and
evidently feeling confident he had impressed the Commandant
as an innocent man, and to show that he could
produce a guilty man, he informed the court that one of
his fellow-prisoners, John Taylor, alias John Setton,
alias Wells—“and sometimes going by other names he,
Mason, could not recall”—as one of the guilty parties.
That prisoner, Mason insinuated, could give much information
regarding the robbing of Owsley’s boat and
other robberies, for he knew John Taylor was implicated
in them.</p>

<p>John Setton, the man of various aliases, was brought
before the Commandant to testify. He admitted that
he had changed his name to John Taylor, but explained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
that he did so because Samuel Mason demanded it, and
that he suspected Mason had some specific purpose in
insisting upon the name of John Taylor. He also admitted
(and probably in a triumphant way) that Samuel
Mason was correct in his statement that he, “one
of Mason’s fellow prisoners, could give much information
regarding robberies.” He said that he had been
with the Masons since May 14, 1802—eight months.</p>

<p>He swore he was an Irishman and had come to
America in 1797, and shortly thereafter enrolled in
Major Geyon’s corps but “deserted near the high
coast.” Reaching Nogales (Vicksburg) he “worked
for three weeks for His Majesty the King of Spain,”
and then went down the river in the “row-gally Louisiana”
to New Orleans where, during the winter, he
found occupation as a carpenter. After this, for a
period of about two years, he shifted around in Spanish
territory, either working with white people or “hunting
with Chaquetaw Indians.” One day while in Arkansas
an American officer recognized him as a deserter from
the army and asked for his delivery to a Spanish post.
He was delivered into the hands of the American
authorities and placed in jail. There he met Wiguens,
an American soldier, and a month later both escaped.
They went back to Arkansas and were shortly afterwards
arrested by the Commander of the Arkansas
Post, who considered them suspicious characters and
kept them in jail twenty-eight days. They then found
farm employment for a month with a man named Gibson,
who obtained for them a passport to go hunting on
White River. They hunted until May, 1802, when they
came down the river some distance in a boat and then
crossed over the country to “Little Prairie of the St.
Francis River,” where they sold their skins to one Fulsom.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
They continued their trip, for he, Setton, “wished
to join his family in Pennsylvania.” When “at the
crossing of the Chaquetaws below the river Ares,” they
met, by chance, John and Thomas Mason, Gibson, and
Wilson, and he had been with the Masons ever since.</p>

<p>The Commandant asked Setton whether or not he
was acquainted with “the man Harpe” and he answered
that he had met a man by that name in Cumberland
who had since been killed, but had left a brother, whose
whereabouts was unknown to him. Setton further
stated, upon being questioned, that he did not know
whether or not Harpe and any of the Masons ever had
any dealings together or had ever met, but he felt confident
that Harpe had not been around since he had had
the misfortune to fall into Mason’s hands.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
Setton, continuing his account, swore that John and
Thomas Mason took possession of all his belongings,
and encouraged him to stay by promising him land on
to which he could later move his family and by giving
him a contract “to go after Mother Mason,” who apparently
had some time before refused to live any
longer with her outlaw husband and sons. Setton declared
that from the very day he met the Masons they
had kept him like a prisoner. The promised land had
never materialized and the trip for their mother was
never attempted, but he was obliged to linger with them
because he found no opportunity to escape, and the
Masons never allowed him more than two rounds of
powder at a time.</p>

<p>He asserted that since he had been with the Masons
they had committed no crimes in his presence. They
did not demand that he steal horses, but apparently
expected him to do so. A number of horses had been
brought in and taken away, but he asked no questions
and as he heard no comments made regarding them, he
had no idea how they came or where they went. He
knew, however, that there was an agreement between
the Masons and one Burton, of Little Bay Prairie, who
bought at twenty dollars all the horses the Masons
could supply, provided the animals were such that they
could be sold for about sixty dollars.</p>

<p>The Masons occasionally left home “to repair a chimney”
and if they remained a few days they invariably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
accounted for their prolonged absence by saying they
“could not cross the water,” “lost their repairing tools,”
“were hindered by bad weather,” or “visited friends,”
but in no instance had they given the name of the friend
they claimed to have seen.</p>

<p>Setton related that when he and the Masons were in
Nogales, at the residence of Charles Colin, a Mr. Koiret,
an American citizen, chanced to stop in the house.
Koiret impressed the Masons as a prospective victim,
and he (Setton) being permitted to chat freely with
Koiret, soon proved himself “an interesting conversationalist.”
But when Koiret incidentally remarked that
he was simply passing by on his way looking for outlaws
who had committed crimes along the Natchez
Trace and the Mississippi River, John Mason, on a
pretext, lured him (Setton) away from the officer, and,
in the meantime, other Masons tactfully managed to
“speed the parting guest.” Turning a corner of the
house, he (Setton) unexpectedly ran into Samuel Mason,
who, with drawn dagger, commanded “silence.”
John Mason seized him and the father and son immediately
gagged him, bound his hands and feet, and
dragged him into the house where they held him down
on the floor for about three hours. Feeling that Koiret
had got far beyond hearing distance, they ungagged
and untied him, but continued to guard him closely
until the next day.</p>

<p>Setton swore that shortly after he had received this
brutal treatment Samuel Mason prepared a written
statement in which he, under the assumed name of John
Taylor, made a declaration that he, Phillips, Fulsom,
Gibson, Wiguens, Bassett, and others were implicated
in one or more of three robberies—the Baker, the Owsley,
and the Campbell and Glass robberies—and in it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
further declared that the Masons were in no way connected
with any of these depredations.</p>

<p>After the statement had been prepared the Masons
explained to him that they were going to conduct him
to a justice of the peace and they furthermore convinced
him that should he fail to swear to this written confession
and declaration of the three robberies, they would
kill him before he had a chance to inform the officers
that the statements were false and not his own. He
related how John and Thomas Mason, armed with
guns, and Samuel Mason, who bore no weapon at all,
forced him to the residence of William Downs, a justice
living below Vicksburg, and that, with seeming calmness,
he went through the form required by the law and
the outlaws. He realized that while he and Samuel
Mason were in the house, the two sons were outside in
hiding, prepared to shoot him should the prearranged
signal be given.</p>

<p>The first of the three robberies detailed in the false
affidavit, continued Setton, was the robbery of Baker
on the Natchez Trace, from whom the Masons took
“twenty-five hundred piasters in gold, silver and banknotes.”
For this John Mason had been imprisoned,
but by the aid of his brother Thomas and others, made
his escape. The object of the confession was to show
that he (as John Taylor) and others were the guilty
men and that Mason was absolutely innocent of the
crime. Notwithstanding his purported statement, he
could prove an alibi, for ten days before the robbery
took place, he had been committed to the Arkansas
prison. He suspected that part of the money found
on the Masons by the officials who arrested them was
a part of the booty obtained in the Baker robbery. The
explanation that the money they had was found “in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
bag hanging on a bush near the road” was suggested by
Samuel Mason a few hours before the arrest, saying
at the time, “accounting for it in that way won’t do any
harm.”</p>

<p>“The second crime,” resumed Setton, “was the one
committed on the Mississippi at the crossing of the
Chaquetaws below the river Ares,” where the Masons
robbed a merchant boat belonging to Owsley. The
Masons tried to show that he and Phillips took the lead
in this affair. He swore he was not connected with the
robbery and stated that he understood Phillips had
done nothing more than purchase two guns from the
boatman and was in no way involved with the men who
later bought all the guns that were on the boat, and,
with the newly purchased guns attacked the boat and
robbed it.</p>

<p>The third robbery Mason wished to throw upon the
shoulders of Phillips and others by inserting it in the
false affidavit, was the one that occurred on “the road
from Kentucky to Natchez,” in which Campbell and
Glass were deprived of several horses, saddles, and
some money. Near the site of this robbery there later
was discovered a sign on a tree, reading “Done by Mason
of the Woods.” The Commandant asked Setton
whether or not he thought Mason was guilty of this
hold-up and he answered that he did not know but, in
his opinion, the stratagem fitted Mason, who, if guilty,
could cite it as an instance of the “workings of his enemies”
and would be prepared to prove “that he was elsewhere
when the robbery occurred.” Anthony Glass, the
witness thought, was a party to the deception, for he had
been a poor man in Nogales until he came in contact
with the Masons.</p>

<p>On one occasion Mason proposed to Setton that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
capture a certain store boat, drown the owner, rob the
boat, and then sell the goods to Glass, who would pay
cash for half its actual value and never betray them.
He asserted that he refused to participate in the proposed
venture, but he suspected that the program was
carried out during one of the “chimney repairing” trips
and that some of the booty could be located by Glass.</p>

<p>He also declared that the pistol the Masons showed
Downs and claimed to be Setton’s had never belonged
to him. It was one the Masons had taken during the
Baker robbery and had originally belonged to Sheriff
William Nicholson, whose initials had been inlaid with
silver thread in the handle but had been removed by
the Masons, who were not aware that he (Setton) saw
them make the change. This very pistol, he said, was
now among the goods the officials had taken possession
of and was the same one that Samuel Mason carried to
Downs, expecting to use it as evidence against him
when the case came to trial.</p>

<p>Setton explained that two of the saddle bags now in
possession of the Masons were originally tan “and had
large tacks fastened at their corners” and that the tacks
were broken off by Samuel Mason and the leather
dyed black. He also stated that the original color of
the trunk they had was red and had been blackened in
his presence by Thomas and John Mason.</p>

<p>Setton, in his comments on the Mason family, remarked
that every member treated him equally bad,
except Thomas, who at times seemed somewhat human.
From the conversations of the Masons he inferred that
“the father had been a thief and a rascal for more than
forty years.” On one occasion, Samuel Mason, “after
taking three measures,” boasted to him that he was “one
of the boldest soldiers in the Revolutionary War” and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
that “there was no greater robber and no better capturer
of negroes and horses than himself.”</p>

<p>On another occasion, after he began to feel his liquor,
he pointed with pride to the fact that he had two partners,
Barret and Brown, who did some killing as a side
line and always shared the spoils with him in consideration
of the advice and powder he furnished them.
Setton also stated that Mason had related to him that
when Mason’s eldest daughter was married, he had
arranged with Barret, Brown, and others to steal as
many of the horses of the guests as they could while the
guests were feasting at the bridal celebration, and that
when the discovery of the theft became known, no man
displayed more eagerness to pursue the horse thieves
than Samuel Mason himself. A few days later some
of the men who had taken the horses were captured and
accused Mason of being the promoter of the theft, but
because of the absurdity of the accusation Mason experienced
no difficulty in proving his “innocence.”</p>

<p>In his comments on John Mason’s wife, Setton said
more than once she pretended to be sick and requested
her husband to send for Dr. Wales, whom she knew
well, but it was his opinion that the woman simply
wished “to chat with the physician” and also “to force
the family cooking upon some one else.”</p>

<p>Setton cited another instance of Mrs. John Mason’s
nature. He related that one day in his presence and
in the presence of two or three of the Masons, Barret,
who had lately shown signs of being dissatisfied with
the treatment he received, declared he would denounce
the whole family. Mrs. Mason, hearing this, immediately
jumped up in a rage, knocked Barret’s hat off his
head and shouted: “Monster, you are not going to denounce
me or any of us!” She was about to plunge a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
long knife into Barret’s heart, when Thomas interfered,
saying: “It is better to part as friends than to part after
a fight,” and peace was restored.</p>

<p>After Setton’s testimony had been heard, the Commandant
on the following day, January 20, ordered
Samuel Mason to appear again. Mason admitted that
he had, in a way, detained Setton, but did so in justice
to himself and his sons. The Owsley boat, he swore in
his explanation, had been robbed in April, 1802, and
immediately thereafter the rumor had become current
that the Masons were the guilty men. Mason declared
that Owsley did not know by whom he and his five boatmen
had been robbed, but in recounting the affair Owsley
referred to two incidents which in themselves were
sufficient to distinguish this robbery from any other.
The first was that after the boat had been plundered,
one of the three robbers returned five dollars to one of
Owsley’s boatmen who had been seriously wounded
during the short battle that took place before the boat
was captured. The other incident was that after the
robbery the outlaws placed a sign on a tree, reading,
“Done by Samuel Mason of the Woods.” John and
Thomas had heard this account a number of times and
every version had it that Samuel Mason was accused
of the work.</p>

<p>When his two sons first met Setton and Wiguens, who
were strangers to them, Setton told them the details of
the Owsley robbery, including these two incidents, and
a few hours later, after the brothers had made a more
favorable impression, Setton confided in them, saying
he and Wiguens and also Gibson were among the perpetrators
of the robbery. John and Thomas Mason,
then recognizing in the two men the outlaws who had
committed at least one of the robberies of which their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
father was being accused, decided to entice Setton and
Wiguens to join them and in the meantime seek an opportunity
to force them into a public declaration of
their guilt and thus vindicate the Mason family. They
succeeded in detaining Setton, admitted Samuel Mason,
but Wiguens escaped.</p>

<p>Samuel Mason, in his comments on the Baker boat
robbery, stated that a few days after the boat had been
pillaged, Colonel Baker and a number of other men
came to the Mason home near Natchez. The moment
Baker saw John he ordered his arrest, saying, “I could
pick him out of a thousand.” The father proceeded to
explain to the Commandant that Baker’s mistake could
be easily explained, as John Mason and Wiguens resembled
each other very much, and added that shortly
after Wiguens and Setton first met his two sons, Wiguens
told John confidentially that he, Setton, Bassett,
Gibson, Fulsom, Phillips, and others were in the Baker
robbery.</p>

<p>Going into details, Mason explained that, according
to Setton’s version, Bassett, Fulsom and Phillips were
the men who bought for cash all the guns Baker had on
hand and left the boatmen under the impression that
these arms were to be used in a search for the Mason
gang. Setton then told him confidentially that he and
the other members of their band, by prearrangement,
appeared shortly thereafter and robbed Baker of all his
money and as much of the goods as they could carry.
Fulsom, in order to inspire courage in the raiders,
assured them they need not fear any pursuing party
which Baker might organize, for he (Fulsom) could on
very short notice, muster and command five hundred
Chacquetaw Indians who would easily annihilate the
revenge-seeking Baker. Setton, in concluding his account<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
to the Masons, laughingly remarked that it was
strange that two men looking so much alike should be
“involved” in the same robbery, and that the guilty man
should not be suspected and the innocent one be accused.
Shortly after this Wiguens suddenly disappeared, very
much to the disappointment of the Masons, who now
realized the necessity of guarding Setton more closely.</p>

<p>Samuel Mason (digressing to another Baker robbery)
asserted that after Baker had been robbed on the
Natchez Trace, Baker and the officers came to arrest
John. John submitted immediately, feeling confident
that his innocence would be speedily proven. He could
have vindicated himself had not some of Bassett’s
friends refused to declare that they saw John many
miles from the scene of the robbery when it occurred.
After he had been in prison about two months “he was
liberated by men who did not make themselves known
to him.”</p>

<p>The Baker highway robbery having taken place on
the American side and the Owsley robbery on the
Spanish side, John, fearing he would be arrested on
either side of the river, took his family and hid in the
woods for a number of weeks. He hoped that in the
meantime his innocence would become established by
the guilty parties being brought to justice. But, instead,
suspicion against him and against the entire
Mason family grew stronger day by day.</p>

<p>Samuel Mason admitted that he had brought John
Setton before a magistrate. He further stated that a
number of things found in their possession the day of
the arrest in Little Prairie were taken by them from
Setton and held as evidence of his connection with some
of the robberies of which the Masons were accused.</p>

<p>He asserted that after he had urgently requested Setton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
to declare his (Setton’s) crime before a magistrate,
and thus, perhaps, receive clemency, “he consented to
do so.” He and Setton then went “about twelve miles
below Nogales” to the office of William Downs, a magistrate.
Mason carried with him a pistol Setton told
him he had procured as a part of his booty from the
raid on the Owsley boat. William Downs “received
Setton’s confession but was not able to take his oath, as
he had no sheriff on guard with him.” Mason then,
without informing Setton, went in search of Anthony
Glass, who, it was rumored, was part owner of the
Owsley boat, to have him serve as a witness to the
affidavit. Mrs. Glass implored her husband not to act,
for she feared his doing so might lead to the exposure
of her brother, one Bassett, who had participated in
various robberies. Glass, however, pacified his wife by
telling her that since Setton was a deserter any sworn
statement he might make would necessarily be ignored,
and then insisted that he would go to Downs and there
denounce Setton as a deserter and have him placed in
the hands of the military authorities.</p>

<p>When the two men arrived at the magistrate’s house
“they discovered that Setton, suspecting some trickery,
had left.” A few weeks later, Mason swore, Setton
again joined the Masons and had been with them ever
since. After finishing his testimony Mason suggested
that “If Setton told the truth in the testimony he gave in
this trial, our statements must agree.”</p>

<p>The next morning, January 21, John Mason appeared
before the Commandant. The prisoner evidently
did not know the contents of his father’s and
Setton’s testimony, but he undoubtedly had some idea
of how his father intended to answer many questions
should they be asked. Most of his testimony agreed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
in the main, with his father’s. He tried to show the
Commandant that he had long attempted to “vindicate”
and “establish” himself and to live “a decent life.” He
said he had escaped from prison because he realized
that the defense of his name required his personal attention.
He swore that practically all he knew about the
various robberies regarding which he was questioned,
was through reports he had heard from John Setton,
alias John Taylor alias Wells, and from Druck Smith,
alias Smith Gibson. He insisted he had never seen
Phillips, Fulsom, and the other Gibson referred to.</p>

<p>The question of how the Masons came into possession
of the eight horses had not been asked before. John
Mason accounted for each by giving the details of a
purchase or trade. He was asked why “he pursued the
two Frenchmen in a boat until they had reached a safe
harbor.” His explanation was that he, Thomas, and
Setton were on the river and followed these men, suspecting
them to be robbers involved in some of the
acts of which the Masons were accused. He hoped that
if they were he would succeed in having them verify
Setton’s declaration of his own guilt. When the two
men reached Nogales his boat was on the point of overtaking
them. He then discovered that they were French
officials and the pursuit was dropped without giving the
men any reasons for the chase.</p>

<p>He swore that most of the notes and paper money
found in their possession belonged to Setton, who
claimed he had “found it in a bag hanging on a bush
near the road,” and who on one occasion remarked
that since then he had more money than he could use.
John Mason added that this statement convinced him
that Setton had stolen the money.</p>

<p>The record of this sworn statement made by John<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
Mason is abruptly followed by “And the prisoner being
asked by the interpreter whether he had anything further
to say or anything to unsay, he answered ‘No,’ but
requested, as his father had done before him, that we do
not hand him over to the United States Government,
and after his declaration was read to him, he persisted
that it was true.”</p>

<p>Thomas Mason followed his brother John and, like
him, gave evidence that agreed, in the main, with his
father’s. He swore his occupation was “farming and
harvesting” and “bringing down flour and whiskey” in
boats. He admitted that he had heard of the Baker and
Owsley robberies but claimed he knew none of the details
except those told to him by Setton, and these he
repeated.</p>

<p>When he was asked about Setton’s appearance before
the magistrate, he answered that he had accompanied
him to Downs’ but did not force him to make an affidavit.
He added that John Mason had received a message
from the Governor of Natchez to the effect that if
he produced a witness who would turn state’s evidence
it would “tend to clear him of his guilt;” hence, their
anxiety to have Setton make a declaration.</p>

<p>After hearing Thomas Mason’s version of the subjects
that had been discussed by the preceding witnesses,
the Commandant, who evidently had been informed
that day that the Masons had also maneuvered further
north, asked him whether or not he knew a man named
Mosique and the two Duff brothers while in Illinois.
He answered he had heard of them and understood that
one of the brothers had been killed by Indians. His
answers to other questions were to the effect that he
knew nothing of the robbing of a negro in St. Louis, of
a man named Lecompte, and of a stolen negro woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
who had been sold to a priest named Manuel. The officer
then asked him whether or not he was aware that
the Masons were accused of these crimes, “but the witness
continued to profess he had never heard of them.”</p>

<p>The fifth prisoner was Marguerite Douglas, wife of
John Mason. She swore she had been married eight
years. She answered that to her “keen regret” she had
heard of the robberies of which her husband and the
other Masons were “so falsely accused.” Her knowledge
of these acts, she swore, was based solely on hearsay.
Among other things, she said Setton told her that
robbing the Baker boat proved as easy “as robbing some
old woman.” She also swore she knew nothing about
the paper money found in their possession and could not
account for the money and goods discovered among her
personal belongings other than by suggesting that in
packing up so hurriedly she may have placed some of
Setton’s personal property in her bag.</p>

<p>Samuel Mason Jr., in his testimony stated that he
was eighteen years old and that he had lived with his
parents all the time until about three months previous.
He said his father and brothers had left his mother at
Bayou Pierre—between Natchez and Vicksburg—and
were away for the purpose of establishing a new home,
and that she was now ill and living with her daughter,
Mrs. Philip Briscoe. The Commandant remarked to
him: “You ought to speak the truth for you have a
mother, who, it is reported, is a good and honorable
woman, and you ought not to be mixed up in the wickedness
of your father and brothers, who, it is said, are
guilty of many thefts and robberies.” The answers he
gave to the few questions asked him agreed with those
given by his father.</p>

<p>Magnus Mason, the last of the prisoners, was called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
upon January 24. He stated he was about sixteen years
old and was born “in Kentucky on the south side of
Green River.” (The others had claimed Pennsylvania
as their native state.) In answer to questions he stated
that he had lived “part of his time with his father in
Kentucky and part with his mother in Bayou Pierre
near Natchez.” He declared his father had spent practically
all of the past two years away from home trying
“to discover men who were committing the robberies.”<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>The next witness was Dr. Richard Jones Waters, the
man on whose recommendation the passport had been
granted to Samuel Mason. Dr. Waters said he first
met Mason in 1791 or 1792 at “Red Banks on the
Ohio,” (now Henderson, Kentucky) which was after
he (Dr. Waters) had settled in New Madrid. He had
been traveling in America and on his return, coming
to the Ohio River, engaged Charles Lafond, a merchant,
and two other men who were on their way to
New Orleans, to take him down as far as New Madrid.
When the boat reached the Falls of the Ohio (Louisville)
Lafond, hearing that he intended to remain there
a few days, asked permission to let the boat proceed to
Red Banks, where Lafond expected to dispose of some
of the goods on board. The permission was granted
on condition that Lafond, without fail, wait for him
there. In due time he (Dr. Waters) reached Red
Banks and then met Samuel Mason for the first time.
Mason claimed that Lafond had gone fishing a few
days before and, in the meantime, started his boat south.
He (Dr. Waters) did not know whether or not Lafond
and his boat ever reached New Orleans, and not until
recently, had he suspected foul play.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
A year after this, continued Dr. Waters, he was traveling
down the Ohio River, stopped at Red Banks and,
to his surprise, met Samuel Mason again. Mason
asked him to come to the house to prescribe for Mrs.
Mason who was sick in bed. The doctor complied and
the result was a trade in which Mason bought seventy
dollars worth of medicine and merchandise, paying
forty dollars in meat and giving him a demand note for
thirty dollars on Felic Concer, of New Madrid. But
when he arrived at New Madrid he learned that Concer
had left for parts unknown. In 1798, however,
Mason paid the note. He then saw nothing more of
Mason until March, 1800, when he met him and his
son Thomas and a man by the name of Smith who said
they had come to New Madrid for drugs. They purchased
some medicine from him for Mrs. John Mason
and other members of the family and paid for it with
merchandise which they claimed they had bought from
a store boat. A few days later Samuel Mason called
again, not to buy medicine but to ask his assistance in
procuring a passport for land on Spanish territory.
This he was, at first, unwilling to give, for, although
he knew nothing unfavorable concerning the family,
he was not assured of their character. After the old
man had pleaded with him and declared that although
rumor had done all the Masons great injustice he
would never regret the endorsement of his character, he
procured a passport, giving to the clerk at the time a
history of his acquaintance with Mason. A few days
afterward Thomas Mason informed him that he was
obliged to go to Kentucky to straighten out some business
affairs before he settled on the land that would be
granted them. He entrusted Thomas Mason with
“some valuable papers for delivery at the Falls of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
Ohio.” These papers reached their destination but
much later than Thomas had promised. No explanation
of the delay was offered or demanded.</p>

<p>The record of the proceedings shows that January
26 was devoted by the officials to inspecting the belongings
of the Masons and approximating their value.
The saddles and pistols referred to by Setton were
found as described by him. There was also discovered
some “twenty twists of human hair of different shades
which do not seem to have been cut off voluntarily by
those to whom the hair belonged.” These and a number
of other evidences were laid aside by the inspectors.
The belongings were estimated at about six hundred
dollars in value. The silver and paper money amounted
to seven thousand dollars, much of which, however,
“appears to be counterfeit.”</p>

<p>The next day Francois Derousser, a citizen of New
Madrid, came forward, stating that he had an important
declaration to make concerning the prisoners. He
explained that he was a native of Illinois and that in
1791, when he and his family were coming down the
Ohio River and had reached a point near Red Banks,
where they happened to make a landing, a man—the
one he now recognized among the prisoners as Samuel
Mason—stepped up to him and, pushing a gun against
his stomach, threatened to shoot him if he did not follow.
He was led into a hut, where several persons
were sitting. Immediately after entering, Samuel
Mason shouted: “This is the man who stole my horses
and slaves and sold them to the Indians,” and, looking
around for a rope, Mason seemed to be making preparations
to hang him at once. He finally convinced
Mason that he could not possibly have been guilty of
the thefts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
After keeping him in chains all night, continued
Derousser, Mason permitted him to leave, but while
he was making some repairs on his boat to resume his
trip, Mason came to him and persuaded him to remain
two months and work with the Mason boys. Mason
promised him a certain quantity of linen, calico, and
bed covers for his services and, needing these badly for
his family, he accepted the proposition. At the end of
the specified time the promised goods were given to
him; but three hours after he had received them and
while on his way to his boat, Samuel Mason and a Captain
Bradley overtook him and robbed him of all the
goods. That night he managed to return to his boat
and with the aid of Eustache Peltier succeeded in cutting
the ice from around it. He started down the river,
and after much suffering from cold and hunger he and
his family finally landed at New Madrid, where they
had lived ever since.</p>

<p>Eustache Peltier appeared before the Commandant,
confirmed the declaration made by Derousser, and
added that he had heard that a certain Lafond, “an
European merchant with an emporium of goods in
New Orleans,” had stopped at the Mason’s house near
Red Banks one night about the time he and Derousser
made their escape, but neither the merchant nor the
boat in which he traveled had been heard from since.</p>

<p>Pierre Billeth, another citizen of New Madrid, declared
that he knew some facts bearing on the Masons
and felt it his duty to report them. He related to the
Commandant that during an excursion in August, 1798,
on the Cumberland River, near the mouth, he heard a
negro woman belonging to Samuel Mason tell Rees
Jones and James Downs that her master had forced her
to help dispose of the body of one of his victims. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
declared that Mason after stabbing and robbing the
man had commanded her to help tie a rope around his
neck and drag the body to the Ohio, where they threw
it in to the water. This same woman had been stolen
by Mason and later sold at public auction by Sheriff
James Downs, then of Kaskaskia, to Father Manuel, a
priest, who lived near St. Genevieve.</p>

<p>All the witnesses having been examined, and the
declarations and proclamations heard, the Commandant
January 29, 1803, ordered an itemized account of
the cost of the trial, including the expenses incurred in
making the arrest at Little Prairie. The account rendered
shows that the largest single item was for “the
sergeant and nineteen militiamen for seventeen days’
guard and sentinel watch of prisoners, at one piaster
per day, three hundred and forty piasters.” Twenty-two
men, besides the officers, were employed in making
the arrest and bringing the prisoners to New Madrid,
for which they received one hundred and seventy-six
piasters. Another item reads, “irons and cuffs made
for prisoners, eight piasters.” The total expense is
given as one thousand fifty-three piasters, or about
one thousand dollars.</p>

<p>The last entry is dated January 31, 1803, and, like all
the others, is presented in monotonous legal phraseology.
It ends with the statement that: “We [the Commandant]
hereby direct that the proceedings of this
trial, originally set down in writing on ninety-one sheets
of paper written on both sides, as well as the pieces of
evidence tending to conviction, together with seven
thousand piasters in U. S. banknotes, be forwarded to
the Honorable Governor General by Don Robert McCoy,
Captain of the Militia, whom we have charged to
conduct the prisoners, Mason and consorts, to New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
Orleans with the view of their trial being continued
and finished, if it so please the Honorable Governor
General.”</p>

<p>And here ends the record of the preliminary trial of
the Masons. Captain McCoy, having been appointed
to conduct the prisoners to a higher court, made his
preparations and in due time started for New Orleans.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_11">Mason and Harpe—Double-Cross and Double Death</h2>
</div>

<p>Out of the mass of perjury and counter-accusations
brought out at this examination only one thing was
clear—that is that Mason and his gang, as far as testimony
and confession went, were not guilty of any crime
on the Spanish side of the Mississippi. Whatever
crimes they may have committed it was essential to their
present safety to locate them on the American or eastern
side of the river. The Spanish authorities had no
power to punish them for violations of law on American
territory, but the Spanish Intendant Salcedo at
New Orleans had the power under the comity existing
between the Spanish and American governments to
deliver them up to the American authorities. The
New Madrid court, therefore, ordered the prisoners
to be transferred to New Orleans and brought before
the intendant.</p>

<p>At that point in the march of events fate took relentless
grip on Samuel Mason and Little Harpe, alias
Setton, for their crimes. The way of atonement was as
swift as its end was to be terrible. It might be quickly
summarized, but there is the better way of pursuing the
astonishing and dramatic story through the faded records
and old scraps of publications of those times, thus
getting into actual touch with the persons and with the
primitive conditions under which this strange duel of
two master criminals was fought out. Each feared the
other; Mason, perhaps, not knowing his antagonist.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
The grim headsman was silently stalking both. In the
language of crime fate was double-crossing both.</p>

<p>From New Madrid to New Orleans was a distance
of about nine hundred miles and to travel it by boat in
those days required more than two weeks. It was as if
it had been decreed that Mason should make a farewell
tour through a part of the country in which he had
become so execrated. New Orleans was then the capital
of the Spanish province of Louisiana, the seat of
the highest court, and had been for more than three-quarters
of a century the most important town on the
Mississippi.</p>

<p>In 1803 New Madrid was a frontier settlement about
fourteen years old. It was a military post occupied by
a small force of soldiers and a town with a population
of about eight hundred who were French, American,
Canadian, and Spanish, or an extraction of these peoples.
New Madrid remained under Spanish rule until
1804 when, as a part of the province of Louisiana, it
became a part of the territory of Louisiana acquired by
the United States.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>If an official account of what followed Mason’s
trial at New Madrid was kept it may now exist among
the archives in old Madrid in Spain and may contain
data relative to the transfer of the prisoners. At any
rate, Captain McCoy and his guard evidently started
for New Orleans early in February, 1803. It is more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
likely that, as a matter of economy and convenience,
they traveled down the Mississippi in a flatboat. The
records show that some of the goods found in the possession
of the Masons were carried along as evidence.</p>

<p>There is neither written history nor oral tradition
telling of Captain McCoy’s departure for New Orleans
or how he held his prisoners on board during the trip.
At least one very probable scene, however, presents
itself, and in it John Setton is the central figure. Samuel
Mason was then the most widely known bandit in
the Mississippi Valley. But in the eyes of the law
Setton now suddenly became the most important character
of all the outlaws. He was likely to turn state’s
evidence, reveal many robberies that were long standing
mysteries, and thus convict not only Samuel Mason
and his family, but also point out clues that would lead
to the extermination of all river pirates.</p>

<p>The boat was necessarily crowded, for even under the
most encouraging circumstances room on a flatboat was
limited. There were about seventeen persons on board:
Captain McCoy, the interpreter, some five men who
constituted the guard and crew, the seven prisoners,
and the three children. Setton was probably chained
in the most conspicuous place where he could be carefully
watched. This must have been done not only to
prevent his escape, but also to prevent Samuel Mason
from trying to persuade him to act in a plot against the
crew, or to dictate to him a forthcoming “confession.”</p>

<p>One can easily imagine that Captain McCoy and his
men frowned at Setton as they would at a chained
sheep-killing dog. There was nothing about him to
attract them. On the contrary, he was repulsive. Setton’s
countenance, according to one writer, was always
downcast and fierce, his hair red, his face meager and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
his stature below that of the average man. This combination
gave him, as Judge James Hall puts it, “a suspicious
exterior.” He was about thirty years of age
and looked the part of a man who was too much of a
villain to smile and thereby try to hide some of his villainy.
To his captors he was nothing more than a
vicious dog whose life was being spared solely that he
might later give Mason a long-deserved, fatal bite.</p>

<p>They not only looked upon him as a thief and murderer,
but also as a fool not fit to live. If he were
guilty of the crimes Mason laid at his feet, then hanging
was too mild a punishment for him. By the same
token, if guilty, he was a fool to permit a notorious
outlaw to dictate to him just what to confess and whom
to implicate. And if he were innocent of the crimes
he was even a greater fool for submitting to Mason’s
demand and declaring in an affidavit that he, not Mason,
was the guilty man.</p>

<p>With Captain McCoy and his guards on one side,
and Samuel Mason and his family on the other, Setton
stood alone between “the devil and the deep blue sea.”
He and Mason were figuratively and literally in the
same boat, but Mason had at least the consolation of
knowing that the members of his family on board were
also with him in sympathy and ready to obey his command,
even though it led to certain death.</p>

<p>Judged by their morals Samuel Mason and John
Setton were very much alike, but in their physical
aspect they differed greatly. Mason was then about
fifty-five years old, possibly sixty. Swaney, the old mail-carrier,
who saw him often, described him to Guild:
“He weighed about two hundred pounds, and was a
fine looking man. He was rather modest and unassuming,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
and had nothing of the raw-head-and-bloody-bones
appearance which his character would indicate.”</p>

<p>Henry Howe refers to him as “a man of gigantic
stature and of more than ordinary talents.” William
Darby says: “Mason at any time of his life or in any
situation, had something extremely ferocious in his
look, which arose particularly from a tooth which projected
forwards, and could only be covered with his lip
by effort.”</p>

<p>Regardless of the difference in their physical size
and physiognomy, and regardless of the extent of their
guilt, both men were held for the same crimes and were
now on their way to New Orleans to appear before the
Spanish authorities. Less than a dozen towns and forts
were then scattered along the river and all were small
ones. As the boat slowly floated and sailed down the
wide stream between seemingly endless forest and jungle
covered shores, Mason had ample time to view the
various places where he had committed robberies, and
to recall how successfully he had carried out all his
attempts. The scenes along the Mississippi have undergone
many changes since Mason’s day. Nevertheless,
many of the views have retained enough of their
primitive grandeur to create in the imagination a landscape
of continuous virgin forests and a vivid picture
of what river life was in pioneer days. But, by searching
the old records pertaining to Mason’s career, one
discovers facts that could never have been foreseen by
the wisest prophet nor imagined by the wildest fictionist.</p>

<p>How and when Captain McCoy and his prisoners
arrived at New Orleans has not been ascertained, although
an effort has been made to find newspaper or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
other accounts giving details on the subject. There
is, however, an unpublished official letter in Spanish,
in the Mississippi Department of Archives and History,
which shows that upon Captain McCoy’s arrival
in New Orleans the record of the proceedings of the
trial held at New Madrid was submitted to the Governor
General of Louisiana and his Secretary of War.
These two Spanish officers, after going over the proceedings,
concluded that since the evidence taken did
not prove that Mason had committed any crime on the
Spanish side, the prisoners should be handed over to
the Americans. In due time, therefore, they ordered
them sent to Natchez.</p>

<p>The official letter referred to is dated New Orleans,
March 3, 1803. It was written by Vidal, the Secretary
of War, approved by Manuel Salcedo, the last
Spanish governor of Louisiana, and forwarded to Governor
Claiborne. It briefly reviews the trial and points
out to the Governor of the Mississippi Territory that
the case falls under American and not Spanish jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Governor Claiborne, in all probability, answered
this communication and requested that the Masons be
turned over to him, for Captain McCoy and his men,
taking the prisoners and some of their stolen property,
left New Orleans the latter part of March for Natchez.
What occurred when their boat stopped near Point
Coupee, Louisiana—some two hundred and forty miles
above New Orleans and about one hundred miles below
Natchez—is told in the following news item quoted in
full from <cite>The Western Spy</cite>, published at Cincinnati,
May 4, 1803:</p>

<p>“Extract of a letter from the Reverend John Smith<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
to a gentleman in this town, dated Point Coupee,
March 28, 1803.</p>

<p>“‘You no doubt have received the account of old
Sam Mason’s arrest, with three or four of his sons,
some other villains, a woman and three children, about
thirty miles below New Madrid, by Captain McCoy,
the king’s interpreter and a small party. Captain McCoy
has since taken them to New Orleans in irons, but
as no crime could be charged upon them as being committed
in the Spanish Government, the Governor General
ordered them to be taken to Natchez and delivered
to our Government. The day before yesterday as they
were passing this place the mast of their vessel broke,
a part of the men were sent on shore to make a new one,
and the rest were left to guard the prisoners. In a
short time they threw off their irons, seized the guns
belonging to the boat and fired upon the guard. Captain
McCoy hearing the alarm ran out of the cabin, old
Mason instantly shot him through the breast and shoulder;
he with the determined bravery of a soldier, though
scarcely able to stand, shot him in the head. Mason
fell and rose, fell and rose again, and although in a gore
of blood, one of his party having shot a Spaniard’s arm
to pieces, he drove off McCoy’s party and kept possession
of the boat till evening, when, discovering a superior
force they left the boat, the woman and children
following with great precipitation. There is a party
of Caroles [sic] after them and it is supposed they will
succeed in taking them. The commandant at this place
has offered one thousand dollars for taking old Mason
dead or alive. They will be pursued with the utmost
diligence by a set of determined fellows.’”</p>

<p>Mason escaped March 26, 1803. The report of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
flight spread fast. The same facts that were published
in <cite>The Western Spy</cite> were sent out from Natchez as a
news item, dated April 2, and printed with less detail
in various papers, among them <cite>The Tennessee Gazette</cite>
of April 27, <cite>The Kentucky Gazette</cite> of May 3, and <cite>The
Palladium</cite> of May 5. In the same news item appears
a brief statement to the effect that Governor Claiborne
had received “official information of the arrival at New
Orleans of the French Prefect for the Colony of Louisiana.”</p>

<p>Mason hoped, as already stated, that by showing he
had committed no crimes on the Spanish side of the
Mississippi he would not be punished by the Spanish
authorities. He evidently did not foresee the possibility
of their turning him over to the Americans. At
any rate, the French were taking possession (in form
at least) of Louisiana, and since they had never been
implicated in any strained relations with the states relative
to the free navigation of the Mississippi, Mason
was now in equal danger of pursuit on either side. By
choice or circumstance he risked the American side.
Two months after his thrilling escape from the boat he
was seen about fifteen miles northeast of Natchez. This
is shown in a report dated Natchez, June 6, 1803, published
in <cite>The Palladium</cite> July 14, from which weekly
it was copied by various other papers:</p>

<p>“On Tuesday last the notorious Samuel Mason and
several of his party, all well armed, were seen on the
Choctaw trace near Cole’s Creek. Two detachments
of the militia of Jefferson County were immediately
ordered out by his excellency, the Governor, in pursuit
of them. We have not yet been informed of the result
of this expedition.”</p>

<p>The expedition was a failure. About two months<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
after it was first reported that Mason had been seen
near Cole’s Creek, James May came to Greenville,
Mississippi—a place formerly called Hunston, some
twenty-five miles in a northeasterly direction from
Natchez, and now extinct—and gave an account of his
recent contact with Mason. James May, it will be recalled,
was among the rough characters who were
driven out of Henderson County, Kentucky, about the
time Mason made his departure from there for Cave-in-Rock.
May’s past career was not yet known by the
citizens to whom he made this report. <cite>The Palladium</cite>,
ever reliable but sometimes late, in its issue of September
8, 1803, says:</p>

<p>“By a gentleman from Natchez, we are informed
that about the 25th or 26th of July, a man by the name
of James May, came to Hunston, near Natchez, and
made oath before a magistrate, that sundry articles
of property and money, which he then delivered up, he
had taken from the notorious Samuel Mason, after
shooting him in the head just above the eye. May had
been robbed and taken by Mason on his passage down
the river, and had joined that party. A few days after
which, the company hearing a firing of guns, Mason
ordered his party, May excepted, to hide the horses.
May he directed to hide a skiff. He took his gun with
him, and on his return, whilst Mason was counting his
money to divide with the party, he shot him, put the
money and property on board the skiff, and conveyed
it to Hunston.</p>

<p>“A letter from Natchez, published in the Natchez
paper, confirms the above account. A letter to a gentleman
in this town from his correspondent at Natchez
dated the 25th instant, makes no mention of the above
circumstance, but says: ‘The Masons have removed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
to Mississippi where they have of late committed many
robberies, but no murders that I have heard of.’”</p>

<p>No complete file of any of the newspapers published
in Natchez from 1800 to 1805 has been found.
The few stray copies, located in various large libraries,
contain nothing about Mason’s career. All are too late
or too early to embrace any current news pertaining to
him. Thus it was without success that an effort was
made to verify, by “the Natchez paper” which “confirms
the above account,” the statement regarding
May’s appearance in Greenville in July, 1803, or to
draw on any Natchez paper for any contemporary reports
relative to Mason.</p>

<p>There is nothing in history or tradition to indicate
what action was taken by the authorities after they received
James May’s report. He evidently left Greenville,
but for what purpose can only be surmised. It
is highly probable that, after May presented the
“money and property” he claimed he had taken from
Mason as evidence of his having shot the outlaw for
whom a reward was offered, he was soon convinced
that he had produced no positive evidence at all. Judging
from what took place a few months later, he left for
the purpose of bringing in Mason, dead or alive.</p>

<p>May probably had been “robbed and taken” by Mason
for the same purpose that John Setton had been
detained—to be used as a witness upon whom he might
try to shift the Mason robberies. If so, May’s pursuit
of Mason for the offered reward was stimulated by a
spirit of revenge. He sallied forth, reconnoitered,
and returned; but he did not return to Greenville, nor
alone. He appeared at Natchez and was accompanied
by John Setton. Setton shortly thereafter was recognized
as one of Mason’s band and both men were taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
and committed to jail some time during the latter part
of October. When they were arrested Setton, as shown
by later records, claimed he came to Natchez for the
purpose of turning state’s evidence. <cite>The Kentucky
Gazette</cite>, of November 22, 1803, briefly touches on the
situation as it was about a month before that paper
went to press:</p>

<p>“A letter from a gentleman at Natchez, to his correspondent
in this town, dated 20th October, contains
information that the men who robbed Mr. Elisha Winters,
on his way from New Orleans, have been taken
and committed to jail; so that there is a probability of
his getting his money. They had in their possession
sundry articles taken from the party who were robbed
near Bayou Pierre. One of the robbers has turned
state’s evidence against the rest; and says that if he can
be suffered to go out with a guard, he will take them
where all the papers were hid and a number of other
things with some money. The place is not more than
two days’ ride, and application has been made to the
governor for the above purpose, which will doubtless
be granted.”</p>

<p>The hunt for Mason was now continued with even
greater enthusiasm. Besides the militia stationed at
Natchez and Fort Gibson many men were on watch
for the notorious outlaw and his band. The woods
were full of robber-exterminating and reward-seeking
soldiers and civilians. Mason’s capture was inevitable.
May and Setton evidently formed a pursuing party of
their own. According to one tradition, the two men
discovered Samuel Mason near Rodney, Jefferson
County, Mississippi, and, according to another, they
found him near Lake Concordia, Louisiana, not far
from Natchez. They gained Mason’s confidence and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
succeeded in convincing him that they had returned
in order to follow him as their leader. Then it was
that Mason met the fate he had himself invited.</p>

<p>Monette says: “Two of his band, tempted by the
large reward, concerted a plan by which they might
obtain it. An opportunity soon occurred, and while
Mason, in company with the two conspirators, was
counting out some ill-gotten plunder, a tomahawk was
buried in his brain. His head was severed from his
body and borne in triumph to Washington, the seat of
the territorial [Mississippi] government.” Daniel
Roe, in a letter published in <cite>The Port Folio</cite>, August,
1825, states that the two men “took Mason’s head to
Natchez in the bow of a canoe, rolled up in blue clay,
or mud, to prevent putrefaction.” Resuming Monette’s
account: “The head of Mason was recognized by
many, and identified by all who read the proclamation,
as the head entirely corresponded with the description
given of certain scars and peculiar marks. Some delay,
however, occurred in paying over the reward, owing
to the slender state of the treasury. Meantime, a great
assemblage from all the adjacent country had taken
place, to view the grim and ghastly head of the robber
chief. They were not less inspired with curiosity to see
and converse with the individuals whose prowess had
delivered the country of so great a scourge.”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
One version, which first appeared in print about
1876, has it that “Many fully identified the head by certain
marks thereon, except his wife who as positively
denied it.... The Governor had sent his carriage
for her expressly to come down and testify ...
and many believed Mason fled the country and died in
his bed in Canada.... Mason’s family [probably
his wife and youngest son] then resided in this county,
not far from old Shankstown, and his wife was generally
respected as an honest and virtuous woman by
all her neighbors, and one of her sons was a worthy
citizen of Warren County not many years ago.” This
is quoted in Claiborne’s history from a “Centennial Address”
delivered by Captain W. L. Harper, of Jefferson
County, Mississippi. In 1891 Robert Lowry published
a statement in his <cite>History of Mississippi</cite>, without citing
any authority, that “One of Mason’s gang killed an innocent
man, cut off his head, carried it to the Governor
of Mississippi and claimed the reward.”</p>

<p>May, as already seen, claimed that he had been a
victim of Mason and, a few months previous, had declared
he could find and capture the notorious robber.
Setton, on the other hand, having expressed a desire to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
turn state’s evidence, admitted having been connected
with the outlaw. The situation was interesting, for it
was an unusual one. The head, having been identified
as Samuel Mason’s, the two heroes of the occasion went
before a judge to make an affidavit and to get an order
on the governor for the payment of the reward. “But
just as the judge was in the act of making out a certificate,”
writes Claiborne in his <cite>History of Mississippi</cite>,
“a traveler stepped into the court room and requested
to have the two men arrested. He had alighted at the
tavern, had repaired to the stable to see his horse attended
to, and there saw the horses of the two men who
had arrived just before him. He recognized the
horses (principally because each had a peculiar blaze
in the face) as belonging to parties who had robbed
him and killed one of his companions some two months
previous on the Natchez Trace, and going into the
court house, he identified the two men.”</p>

<p>Suspicion was immediately aroused. This declaration
not only showed that May, who complained of
being robbed, was a robber himself, but it also indicated
that the “reformed” Setton as well as the “victimized”
May, had committed at least one robbery since they
left Greenville in search of Mason. Who are May and
Setton, and where do they come from, and what have
they been doing for a living? Such questions were
asked. Absolutely nothing was known about May. As
to Setton, their information was limited to the report
that he had been “badly treated” by Mason; some may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
have known that he had traveled under assumed names,
but evidently none yet suspected he was Little Harpe.</p>

<p>The next step in the development of their careers is
given in one of Draper’s manuscripts written after an
interview with Colonel John Stump, who was born in
1776: “In the winter of 1803–4 old Captain Frederick
Stump, commanding a company under Colonel George
Doherty, went as far as Natchez to aid in taking possession
of Louisiana. There Captain Stump, by invitation
of Governor Claiborne, an old friend, made his quarters,
and was present when Setton and May came with
Mason’s head to claim the reward of one thousand dollars.
The Governor told them to call at a stated time
and the check would be ready for them. After they had
gone Captain Stump said he believed that Setton was
really Little Harpe.... The description of Little
Harpe so well corresponded with Setton’s appearance
that it was agreed to arrest them both.... It was
proclaimed at the landing of Natchez that it was believed
that Wiley Harpe was taken, and if any Kentucky
boatman had any personal knowledge of him,
they were desired to examine the prisoner. Five boatmen
recognized him and gave in their evidence to that
effect. Some of them were witnesses in the Harpe case
when they broke from the Danville jail. Said one of
these boatmen before seeing him: ‘If he is Harpe he has
a mole on his neck and two toes grown together on one
foot.’ And so it proved, and the fellow with such positive
proof against him shed tears.” [<a href="#B121">121</a>]</p>

<p>Shortly after this, John Bowman, of Knoxville, Tennessee,
called in to see the two men. He recognized
Little Harpe. “Little Harpe denied the name, but
Bowman persisted and said, ‘if you are Harpe you have
a scar under your left nipple where I cut you in a difficulty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
we had at Knoxville.’ Bowman tore the man’s
shirt open and there was the scar.” [<a href="#B26">26</a>]</p>

<p>Up to this time, Little Harpe, under the names of
John Taylor, John Setton, and Wells, had succeeded in
concealing his identity. He now realized that even
though he turned state’s evidence against the Masons,
the history of his own terrible career in Tennessee and
Kentucky and at Cave-in-Rock was too well and widely
known for him to expect any mercy, no matter how
important his revelations regarding the Masons might
be. At New Madrid he had a narrow escape from being
identified. After he and the Masons were captured
and taken to the Spanish prison, it was rumored that one
of the prisoners was “a fellow who calls himself Taylor
but who is supposed to be that notorious villain and
murderer Harpe.” A statement to that effect was written
in a letter dated January 24, 1804, and published six
weeks later in <cite>The Western Spy</cite>. But, as already
seen, he had sworn before the New Madrid court, as
John Setton, that he had met a man by the name of
Harpe who had been killed and, when further questioned,
declared that he knew nothing regarding the
whereabouts of Little Harpe. Although his identity
was now well established, he, in self-defense, persisted
in denying the name. Escape was his only hope.</p>

<p>Nothing was then known about James May’s past
other than his recent acts connected with the beheading
of Mason and his attempted apprehension of the Mason
band. These acts in themselves exposed him as a man
of such a treacherous character that he could expect no
mercy nor any reward. On the other hand, should he
be identified as one of the men who had been driven out
of Henderson County, Kentucky, and be accused of
Cave-in-Rock murders and robberies, then nothing but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
the severest punishment that could be inflicted upon
him might be expected. With him, as with Little
Harpe, escape was his only hope. And both escaped.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p>How Little Harpe and May escaped is not known.
While at Natchez they may have been indicted for Mason’s
murder. If so, having killed Mason in compliance
with the governor’s proclamation to capture the
outlaw dead or alive, they were acquitted. William
Darby, then living near Natchez, writes that the two
prisoners “learning their danger fled from Natchez,
but were taken in Jefferson County, Mississippi, and
confined in jail and in due time, tried and convicted....”
They were tried before the Circuit Court
in Greenville, in January, 1804, as is shown by the few
existing entries made in the now mutilated docket book
of that court. No record of the court proceedings was
found, although a careful search was made.</p>

<p>The first entry found in the docket book is dated Friday,
January 13, 1804. The court was presided over
by Peter B. Bruin, David Ker, and Thomas Rodney,
who were among the best known men in Mississippi.
It is an interesting fact that when Aaron Burr was arrested
the following year on Cole’s Creek, near Greenville,
he was tried in Washington, Mississippi, before
two of these same judges, the third, Judge Ker, having
died of pneumonia contracted while serving at the trial
of Harpe and May. William Downs, as foreman of
the grand jury, brought in “an indictment of robbery”
against each of the prisoners: “The Territory against
James May” and “The Territory against John Setton.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
Little Harpe, alias Setton, and his co-worker May were
represented by Mr. Breazeale and Mr. Parrott. These
attorneys evidently made every possible effort to save
their clients. A plea of “not guilty” had been entered.
Then followed much sparring over technicalities. They
first attempted to quash the indictment; they next
claimed the court did not have jurisdiction; and finally
presented a petition for a writ of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">habeas corpus</i>. But
all these contentions were overruled.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> “And for trial
(each) put himself upon the country and General Poindexter,
Attorney General.” Each was tried by separate
jury, James May being the first, and each was found
guilty. Then the two attorneys came forward with “a
plea of former acquittal,” but the court rendered a decision
that “the plea of former acquittal is not sufficient
in law to be considered a sufficient bar to this indictment.”
This plea of “former acquittal” leads one to
infer that when Mason’s head was brought to Natchez
both men were tried there and elsewhere for murder,
and having been “acquitted” of that charge they, in all
likelihood, argued that they were therefore also acquitted
of highway robbery which was incidental to the
murder.</p>

<p>As already stated, the record of the proceedings containing
all these and other details of the case cannot
now be found. There is nothing to indicate who the
witnesses were, except Elisha Winters, who was “allowed
the compensation allowed by law for his attendance
at this term and for traveling to and from said
court one thousand miles.” Among the few available<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
pages of the docket book bearing on this case is one
containing two entries dated February 4, 1804. They
show that the sentence passed was in the same words
for each prisoner. James May’s is the first on the
record, and is immediately followed by Little Harpe’s:</p>

<div id="ip_259" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 36em;">
  <img src="images/i_259.jpg" width="562" height="384" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Gallows Field, Jefferson County, Mississippi</span></p>

<p class="smaller">Here, in 1804, two Cave-in-Rock outlaws were hanged</p>

<p class="smaller">(From a drawing by J. Bernhard Alberts, made in 1917)</p></div></div>

<p>“John Setton who has been found guilty of robbery
at the present term was this day set to the bar and the
sentence of the court pronounced upon him as follows,
that on Wednesday the eighth day of the present month
he be taken to the place of execution and there to be
hung up by the neck, between the hours of ten o’clock
in the forenoon and four in the afternoon, until he is
dead, dead, dead. Which said sentence the Sheriff of
Jefferson County was ordered to carry into execution.”</p>

<p>On Wednesday afternoon, February 8th, Little
Harpe and James May were taken from the jail to a
field about a quarter of a mile north of the village of
Greenville. There, on what has ever since been known
as “Gallows Field,” they received their well deserved
reward, but not the one they had planned to procure.
They paid, with their lives, what was, considering the
atrocity of their crimes, a light penalty.</p>

<p>In pioneer days the official executioner usually prepared
a gallows by fastening one end of a long beam or
heavy pole in the forks of a tree and placing the other
end similarly in another tree. On this cross timber he
tied the rope with which the condemned man was to
be hanged. The prisoner, as a rule, was put on a wagon,
his coffin serving as a seat, and driven to the place of
execution. Upon his arrival the same wagon and coffin
on which he rode were used as the platform and trap
of his gallows. After the suspended rope was properly
looped around his neck the condemned man was made
to stand erect on his coffin. When all details had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
attended to the horses were rushed forward, leaving the
human body hung suspended in the air. In some instances
the gallows was a frame-work with a platform
in which a trap door was built.</p>

<p>In the hanging of Harpe and May the procedure
was somewhat unusual even for a frontier country. Two
ropes were tied to a heavy pole placed high between
two trees. The two men walked from the jail to the
gallows. Each with his hands tied behind him was
made to mount a ladder; his feet were then bound and
the noose fastened around his neck. When the ladders
were dropped the two bodies fell as far as the suspended
rope permitted, and thus each was “hung up by the
neck” until, as prescribed by law, he was “dead, dead,
dead.” [<a href="#B54">54</a>]</p>

<p>The news that Samuel Mason had at last been killed
was a great relief to the country. The fact that Little
Harpe and James May were actually hanged was a
matter of equally widespread interest. <cite>The Guardian
of Freedom</cite>, February 20, 1804, published the following,
which was copied by a number of papers, including
<cite>The Kentucky Gazette</cite> of a week later:</p>

<p>“Extract of a letter from a gentleman in Mississippi
Territory to his friend in this town (Frankfort) dated
February 8, 1804: ‘There have been two of Sam Mason’s
party—which infested the road between this country
and Kentucky—in jail at Greenville for trial. They
were condemned last term and executed this day. One
of them was James May; the other called himself John
Setton but was proved to be the villain who was known
by the name of Little or Red-headed Harpe, and who
committed so many acts of cruelty in Kentucky.’”</p>

<p><cite>The Palladium</cite>, March 3, published a news item
dated Natchez, February 9, 1804: “Setton and May<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
were executed at Greenville yesterday between three
and four o’clock, pursuant to their sentence. We are
informed that Setton made some confession at the place
of execution which has a tendency to implicate several
persons not heretofore suspected as parties concerned
with Masons in their depredations. May complained
of the hardship of his fate; said he had not been guilty
of crimes deserving death and spoke of the benefit he
had rendered society by destroying old Mason.”</p>

<p>The hanging of Little Harpe and James May for
highway robbery was a fulfillment of the written law of
pioneer times as well as the unwritten law of frontier
communities. But many of the enraged citizens felt
that the law of pioneer justice had not been satisfied for
the known and unknown murders committed by these
two offenders. There is nothing in history or tradition
to indicate that an attempt was made to lynch the two
condemned outlaws. But the lynch spirit evidently
raged. In the words of Franklin L. Riley, an authority
on early Mississippi history: “After their execution on
the Gallows Field their heads were placed on poles, one
a short distance to the north and the other a short distance
to the west of Greenville, on the Natchez Trace.”
[<a href="#B105">105</a>]</p>

<p>How long these gruesome warnings to highwaymen
stood along the road and what finally became of them
is not known. Each doubtless met with a fate befitting
a head so ignoble. It is not probable that they were
ever interred in the grave with the two headless bodies.
Tradition has it that the two bodies were placed in a
box and buried in a new grave yard about one hundred
yards east of the Greenville jail and court house and
about the same distance north of the hotel in the central
part of the village.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
This new grave yard was on the Natchez Trace and
contained less than half a dozen graves. Tradition says
that an effort was made by a number of people who had
kinsmen buried in it to influence the officials to bury
elsewhere the decapitated remains of these despised
desperadoes. Their request was not granted, and the
burial was held late on the night of the execution
within a few yards of where stood one of the head-surmounted
poles. The next day the indignant men who
had opposed this as a burial place for the two villains,
exhumed their dead and removed the remains about a
half mile south of Greenville and there began a new
burying ground which today is known as Bellegrove

<p>What attempts were made to collect the reward offered
for the capture of Mason? What became of the
Masons? It is probable these questions can never be
fully answered. The court records showing the total
expense involved in the trial and transportation of the
Masons, and in the trial and execution of Little Harpe
and James May, have not been found. These expenses
were paid by the territorial and federal governments.
One of Governor Claiborne’s letters [<a href="#B113">113</a>] shows that
in January, 1806, one Seth Caston “exhibited demands
for one hundred dollars for apprehending and bringing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
to justice” these two notorious outlaws. There is
nothing indicating the character of Caston’s claim; nor
is there anything to show whether or not he received
any money. Harpe and May were entitled to the reward
offered in Governor Claiborne’s proclamation;
it doubtless would have been granted to them in full
had they not proven that above all other rewards they
best deserved that which they received on the gallows.</p>

<p>Neither history nor tradition tells what became of
the Mason family after Samuel Mason met his fate and
Little Harpe and James May received their reward.
Samuel Mason’s wife, who evidently did not approve
of her husband’s lawlessness—at least not in her later
years—made her home, as we have already seen, not
far from old Shankstown, in Jefferson County, Mississippi.
There, according to Claiborne, the historian, she
was “generally respected as an honest and virtuous woman
by all her neighbors, and one of her sons [probably
Magnus or Samuel Mason Jr.] was a worthy citizen
of Warren County.” Monette says that “the Mason
band being deprived of their leader and two of his most
efficient men, dispersed and fled,” and thus terminated
the greatest terror to travelers which had infested the
country.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p>In the meantime, the headless bodies of Little Harpe
and James May continued to lie in their double grave
near the Natchez Trace. As time rolled on the narrow
Trace widened and, as roads frequently do, it wore
deeper into the slight elevation over which it led.
About the year 1850 this widening and deepening process
reached the fleshless bones in the solitary grave, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
the two skeletons, protruding piece by piece from the
road bank, were dragged out by dogs and other beasts
until the highway widened beyond the grave and the
burial site became part of the ditch along the Natchez
Trace.</p>

<p>Some twenty years ago, upon straightening out a part
of the Natchez Trace, the small section of the old road
of which the burial place was a part, was discarded as
a highway, and today the old road bed, including the
site of the grave, is a mere jungle of briars and brush.</p>

<p>Thus the last vestige of these two villains disappeared
on the very highway upon which they had committed
so many crimes, and possibly on the very spot where
one of their victims breathed his last. The ocean of
time has closed over every one of the personal relics of
all these enemies of society, but the waves that their
activities started still carry on as ripples of human
interest.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_12">Coiners at the Cave</h2>
</div>

<p>The Cave had been used for religious purposes, as a
haven in time of distress, as an inn and as a decoy house
for murder and robbery. Through the widely scattered
references to it in early books of travel and in magazines
and newspapers we find also occasional indications
that it had been, at different times and for short
periods, the workshop and headquarters of counterfeiters.
There are, indeed, few details concerning its
occupation by bandits and criminals of any description;
this is the veil of mystery that shrouds it in enduring
interest. The knowledge that distinct facts about definite
crimes committed there can never be obtained has
challenged the imagination of various writers. Facts
about the counterfeiters who used it are much less in
evidence than facts about those following other forms
of crime; probably because counterfeiting must of
necessity be more secret than other crimes.</p>

<p>There is nothing to indicate that any of the counterfeiters
of Cave-in-Rock were guilty of robbery by force
or of murder. The part they played in outlaw river
life was in the purchase of goods from passing boats
and the payment for these goods in counterfeit coin and
currency. Not until it was too late would the receivers
of such money discover they had been duped. For this
reason the counterfeiters could not long use the Cave
at one time. There were, as far as is known, only three
counterfeiters identified with the Cave. Two of these
were among the first lawbreakers to convert the place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
into a workshop for a nefarious trade; the other was
among the last of its outlaws.</p>

<p>Dr. Frederick Hall, who went up the Ohio in 1839,
states in his <cite>Letters from the East and from the West</cite>
that “this noted cavern is styled Counterfeiters’ Cave.”
He further comments that “in times gone past, never to
revert, it was inhabited by counterfeiters, robbers, and
murderers.” Charles Augustus Murray, in his <cite>Travels
in North America</cite>, writes of his trip down the Ohio in
June, 1835. He says that the current report of the
country at the time of his visit to the Cave, was that
when this den of thieves was finally broken up “it contained
great quantities of gold, silver, silks, and stuffs,
and false money, with an apparatus for coining.”</p>

<p>It is not known what disposition was made of the
coining tools and false money referred to by Murray.
Nor is it known what became of any of the apparatus
and illegal money left behind by the Cave’s other counterfeiters.
The person who expresses the opinion that
an “upper cave” exists, is likely to add that great quantities
of good and bad money are hidden in the undiscovered
cavern. The counterfeiters probably carried away
all their coin and coining apparatus. The only trace of
suggestive evidence preserved today indicating the
former occupancy by counterfeiters is the half of a
double die or mold which was found many years ago in
the vicinity of the Cave. It has been cherished as a
possible relic of the counterfeiting regime there.</p>

<div id="ip_269" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24em;">
  <img src="images/i_269.jpg" width="377" height="554" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Implements and Weapons used by the Outlaws</span></p>
  </div>
  <div class="captionj">
<p class="in0">Counterfeiter’s mold, knife blade, iron tomahawk, and stone idol found in
vicinity of Cave-in-Rock, and a flint-lock pistol of the style used about 1800</p></div></div>

<p>This die was seemingly hidden near the Cave by one
of the men who had used it for the purpose of making
counterfeit half-dollars and the large five-dollar gold
pieces of those days. It is a double plate of iron four
and three-quarter inches long and two and one-quarter
inches wide, welded together. The upper plate is one-eighth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
of an inch thick and in it are cut two discs, each
being one and one-half inches in diameter and having a
gap at the top, opening to a funnel shaped “feeder.”
It is said that a particular local clay or some other suitable
material was placed in the circle and into this pliable
matrix the impression was made of one side of a
genuine half-dollar, or of an old style five-dollar gold-piece,
which was of about the same size. This formed,
when hardened, a more or less durable mold for one
side of the new coin. In like manner another mold was
prepared in the other half of the coining apparatus for
the other side of the counterfeit piece. The two parts
of the mold were then placed in proper position and
the hot metal poured into the cavity through the funnel-like
opening. This process doubtless produced, as a
rule, a more or less crude imitation, but since many of
the genuine coins of an earlier date were somewhat
crude and were still in circulation, the counterfeiters
experienced comparatively little trouble in imitating
the old pieces.</p>

<p>Among the early counterfeiters who made the Cave
their headquarters for a time was Philip Alston, who
looms large in the romance and gossip of the latter part
of the eighteenth and early part of the nineteenth centuries.
He was a gentleman by birth, education, and
early association. He comes down to us handsome in
figure and grand in manner, wearing broad-cloth,
ruffles, and lace. He had an air of chivalry to women
and of aloofness, superiority, and mystery to men. He
was the “Raffles” of pioneer days and legend paints
him in high colors.</p>

<p>Alexander C. Finley, in his <cite>History of Russellville
and Logan County, Kentucky</cite>—a unique publication
from the standpoint of its style—says Philip Alston was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
driven out of the South and settled in Logan County
about 1782. A few years later “his thirst for counterfeiting
again returned.” But “feeling insecure” Alston
moved from place to place in western Kentucky.
“About 1790 he crossed over the Ohio and became the
fast friend and disciple of the notorious counterfeiter
Sturdevant [Duff?] at the Cave-in-the-Rock. But he
did not reside here long before he came to himself and
wondered how he, the gentlemanly Philip Alston,
although an elegant counterfeiter, could have become
the companion of outlaws, robbers, and murderers ...
and so he returned to Natchez.”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
It is quite likely that a counterfeiter named Duff had
been making use of the Cave long before the time of
Philip Alston’s short stay at the place. He may be
regarded as Cave-in-Rock’s first outlaw. Neither history
nor tradition has preserved Duff’s Christian name.
One version suggests that he may have been the John
Duff who met George Rogers Clark on the Ohio, near
Fort Massac in June, 1778, and who, after some bewilderment,
showed General Clark the way to Kaskaskia.
It is not improbable that the two were one and the same
man. At any rate, very little is known of John Duff,
the guide, or of Duff the coiner.</p>

<p>Governor Reynolds in <cite>My Own Times</cite> and Collins,
in his <cite>History of Kentucky</cite> devoted only a few lines to
Duff, and these lines pertain to his death. The author
of <cite>A History of Union County, Kentucky</cite>, prints some
five pages on his career, based on traditions gathered in
1886. Duff apparently lived the latter part of his life
in or near Cave-in-Rock and procured his lead and
silver along the Saline River and in other sections of
southern Illinois. He evidently operated a counterfeiter’s
den in different places. According to tradition,
there were at least three places known as “Duff’s Fort:”
one was at Cave-in-Rock, another at Caseyville, Kentucky
(near the mouth of Tradewater River, fourteen
miles above the Cave) and a third in Illinois, at Island
Ripple on Saline River (thirteen miles above its mouth
and about twenty-eight miles, via river to the Cave).
Like all outlaws of his and other times, Duff was
obliged to shift his headquarters. It is probable that
some of the localities in which he lived no longer have
any traditions regarding his activities there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
In 1790, Philip Alston, as stated by Finley, fled to the
Cave and became a “fast friend and disciple” of Duff.
Collins, in his chapter on Crittenden County, Kentucky,
says that Duff lived near the mouth of Tradewater
River in 1799 and then, or shortly thereafter, was killed
by Shawnee Indians and that “there was reason to believe
some one residing at Fort Massac had employed
the Indians to commit the crime.” Governor Reynolds
briefly states that Duff was killed “near Island Ripple
in the Saline Creek, and was buried near the old salt
spring,” and that “it was supposed the Indians were
hired to commit the murder.” Just where he was killed
cannot be ascertained with any certainty after a lapse
of so many years. There are two or three coves or small
caves on Saline below Island Ripple, each of which is
known as Duff’s Cave, and each has a local tradition
to the effect that Duff was killed in it.</p>

<p>The compiler of <cite>A History of Union County, Kentucky</cite>,
is the only writer who has gathered any Duff traditions,
and since he confined his research to the stories
told in and near Caseyville, his life of this Cave-in-Rock
outlaw does not branch into the many and varied
claims made in local traditions of other sections. Nevertheless,
his sketch of this pioneer and counterfeiter is
one that might be accepted as typical of what would be
found in the other localities in which Duff had made
his headquarters. In sum and substance the story runs
as follows:</p>

<p>Duff lived in a house called “Duff’s Fort,” which
stood near what later became the old site of the Christian
Church in Caseyville. Here he dispensed a rude
but cordial hospitality. On the bluff above was his
meadow. The overhanging cliff near his house furnished
a shelter for his horses. The shallow cove in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
which they stood is now almost filled with alluvial soil
deposited by the little brook which flows near. His
household consisted of his wife and a faithful black
slave named Pompey, who would risk anything or
undergo any hardship for his master.</p>

<p>It is said that Duff was a brave man and a good strategist;
he was seldom found at a disadvantage. He
often had narrow escapes in his encounters with the
officers of the law and the people living in the vicinity.
On one occasion, when he was closely pursued by his
enemies, he ran towards his home. There he found his
wife at the river doing the family washing. Near her
was a large iron kettle, in which she was boiling clothes.
Without hesitation Duff upset the kettle, rolled it into
the stream, where it was quickly cooled, and lifting the
kettle over his head, he plunged into the water. The
river was low at this point, enabling him to wade most
of the way to the farther bank. Before he reached the
Illinois shore, however, his pursuers appeared on the
Kentucky side and opened fire. Their aim was well
directed. Several of the bullets struck the kettle, but
rebounded without injury to the man beneath. On
reaching the dry land he took the kettle from his head.
Holding it behind him as continued protection, he ran
for safety. The pursuers increased their fire. More
bullets rained upon the impromptu shield—but Duff
escaped unhurt to the shelter of the woods.</p>

<p>On another occasion when sorely pressed he took
refuge with a Mrs. Hammack, who was an old-time
Methodist living in that part of the country. She
treated him so kindly that he decided to let her have a
glimpse of his hidden treasures. On the appointed day
he blindfolded her and his wife and led them by a very
circuitous route to a cave. After they were in the mysterious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
cave he removed the bandages from their eyes
and, by the light of torches, the two women were enabled
to see the large quantities of counterfeit silver
and gold coins in boxes and chests stored by Duff. He
then replaced the bandages and took the two women
back to Mrs. Hammack’s house. Mrs. Hammack’s impression
was that the cave ran into the side of a cliff but,
notwithstanding many efforts, she was never able to
retrace her steps to the place. Mrs. Duff related, after
her husband’s death, that he had taken her from their
home to the cave on another occasion and in the same
manner. He then promised her that he would some
day show her the way to his cave, but explained at the
time that he could not then do so, for his enemies might
torture her into a disclosure of his location when he
was in it. His intentions were frustrated by his sudden
death. There are three different accounts of Duff’s
death given by local tradition.</p>

<p>One version has it that he was killed by some of the
citizens of the county, near the bluff where he quartered
his horses. According to this account, a number of men
were pursuing him and when he showed fight they were
obliged to shoot him. Another says he was killed by
Indians with whom he had quarreled about a dog fight.
The following is the version most widely accepted:</p>

<p>Duff, three of his associates, and his slave Pompey,
while in Illinois securing white metal, were surprised
by about six soldiers sent from Golconda, Illinois, or
some other point below Cave-in-Rock. The counterfeiters
were captured and taken down the river in a
boat. Handcuffs were placed upon all the white prisoners.
Pompey had not been manacled because the
soldiers carried only four sets of irons and, furthermore,
they presumed the negro cared little whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
his master was doomed. Near Cave-in-Rock they
stopped for dinner. When they landed, all the soldiers
went ashore except one who was left in charge of the
prisoners and the boat. After stacking their arms near
the boat, they went into the Cave to build a fire and prepare
the meal.</p>

<p>One of the prisoners whispered to Duff that he found
he could slip his irons off. Pompey hearing this, passed
a file to him and, taking advantage of the absence of the
guard, who went ashore for a few minutes, he filed
away at Duff’s fetters and soon succeeded in breaking
them. At a signal, Pompey sprang upon the guard and
tied him to a tree and then proceeded to liberate the two
men chained in the boat. Duff and the other unfettered
prisoner immediately seized the stacked arms and
rushed upon the men in the Cave who, having no side
arms, were forced to an unconditional surrender.</p>

<p>Some of the soldiers were tied and others secured
with irons and all thrown into the boat and set afloat.
They drifted down the river and, as they were floating
opposite the fort from which they had been sent, they
were ordered to stop, but of course could not do so.
They were fired upon a number of times before the
commander discovered their helpless condition. He
then sent out a skiff and brought them ashore. In the
meantime, Duff and his companions had made their
way up the river to the Saline and had got safely
home again.</p>

<p>The inglorious outcome of this expedition greatly
incensed the commander of the fort and he was determined
upon revenge. He accordingly hired a Canadian
and three Indians to go up the river to Duff’s Fort and
kill him. They were to ingratiate themselves into the
good graces of the counterfeiter and watch their opportunity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
to kill him. If they succeeded they were to
return and receive a reward.</p>

<p>They arrived in Duff’s neighborhood and camped
below his house. The Canadian soon became friendly
with Duff, who did not suspect the object of his presence,
and was invited to his house. The genial hospitality
of the counterfeiter was fatal to the Canadian’s
plan, and each day he found himself less inclined to
carry out his murderous scheme. Meanwhile the Indians
were becoming impatient. One evening they
informed the Canadian that they had concluded to kill
Duff the next day, whether he helped or not. He then
decided to put Duff upon his guard.</p>

<p>The next morning, although Duff was drinking
rather heavily, the Canadian disclosed the plot to him.
Duff, seizing a stick, rushed from the house, swearing
he would whip the Indians with it and drive them off.
He met them coming towards his house, painted and
armed for a conflict. Pompey, recognizing the danger
his master was facing, rushed to him with a loaded gun,
but before it could be used the Indians shot Duff and
his slave. “The leader having fallen,” says the author
of <cite>A History of Union County, Kentucky</cite>, in concluding
his account of Duff, “the rest of the gang were
speedily dispersed.”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>

<p>About a generation after the days of Duff there appeared
upon the scene a man named Sturdevant, whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
counterfeiting career continued in the Cave-in-Rock
country until 1831. In the meantime the flatboat
pirates who had used the Cave as their headquarters
had disappeared and the mysterious Ford’s Ferry band
was drifting towards its dispersement.</p>

<p>The identity of Sturdevant is as vague as that of Duff.
Tradition has it that Sturdevant did not counterfeit
money in the Cave but that, beginning about 1825, and
for a short time thereafter, he used the “House of
Nature” as a “Banking House of Exchange.” There
he met his confederates and exchanged, at an agreed
rate, some of the counterfeit money he made in his
fortified home nine miles below the Cave. Judge
James Hall, in his <cite>Sketches of the West</cite>, published in
1835, devotes two pages to Sturdevant. His is the best
of the few published accounts. It is well worth quoting
in full:</p>

<p>“At a later period [that is, after Mason’s time] the
celebrated counterfeiter, Sturdevant, fixed his residence
on the shore of the Ohio, in Illinois, and for several
years set the laws at defiance. He was a man of talent
and address. He was possessed of much mechanical
genius, was an expert artist and was skilled in some of
the sciences. As an engraver he was said to have few
superiors; and he excelled in some other branches of
art. For several years he resided at a secluded spot in
Illinois, where all his immediate neighbors were his
confederates or persons whose friendship he had conciliated.
He could, at any time, by the blowing of a
horn, summon some fifty to a hundred armed men to
his defense; while the few quiet farmers around, who
lived near enough to get their feelings enlisted and who
were really not at all implicated in his crimes, rejoiced
in the impunity with which he practiced his schemes.
He was a grave, quiet, inoffensive man in his manners,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
who commanded the obedience of his comrades and the
respect of his neighbors. He had a very excellent farm;
his house was one of the best in the country; his domestic
arrangements were liberal and well ordered.</p>

<p>“Yet this man was the most notorious counterfeiter
that ever infested our country and carried on his nefarious
art to an extent which no other person has ever attempted.
His confederates were scattered over the
whole western country, receiving through regular channels
of intercourse their supplies of counterfeit bank
notes, for which they paid a stipulated price—sixteen
dollars in cash for a hundred dollars in counterfeit bills.
His security arose, partly from his caution in not allowing
his subordinates to pass a counterfeit bill, or to do
any other unlawful act in the state in which he lived,
and in his obliging them to be especially careful of their
deportment in the <em>county</em> of his residence, measures
which effectually protected him from the civil authority.
Although all the counterfeit bank notes with which
a vast region was inundated were made in his house,
that fact could never be proved by legal evidence. But
he secured himself further by having settled around him
a band of his lawless dependents who were ready at all
times to fight in his defense; and by his conciliatory
conduct, which prevented his having any violent enemies.
He even enlisted the sympathies of many reputable
people in his favor. But he became a great nuisance
from the immense quantity of spurious paper
which he threw into circulation; and although he never
committed any acts of violence himself, and is not
known to have sanctioned any, the unprincipled felons
by whom he was surrounded were guilty of many acts
of desperate atrocity; and Sturdevant, though he escaped
from the arm of the law, was at last, with all his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
confederates, driven from the country by the enraged
people, who rose, almost in mass, to rid themselves of
one whose presence they had long considered an evil as
well as a disgrace.”</p>

<p>Governor Reynolds notes that in 1831 Sturdevant’s
fort was attacked by some Regulators, and that one
Regulator and three counterfeiters were killed, and
“the suspected gang broken up.”</p>

<p>James A. Rose in his article on “The Regulators and
Flatheads in Southern Illinois” says: “Regulators
descended on the Sturdevant stronghold only to find
that their movements had been spied upon and that they
were expected. A number of shots were exchanged;
finally a charge was made on the stockade and the door
broken down. They found, however, that a small piece
of artillery was trained on the stairway leading to the
Sturdevant stronghold, and a halt was called and reinforcements
asked for. During the night Sturdevant
and his band of criminals managed to make their
escape. This is one of the earliest records of the citizens
of this region taking the law into their own hands.”</p>

<p>Sturdevant was never again heard of in that or any
other locality. What became of him is not known.
This attack on his headquarters ended forever counterfeiting
in the Cave-in-Rock country.<a id="FNanchor_36A" href="#Footnote_36A" class="fnanchor">36a</a></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_13">The Ford’s Ferry Mystery</h2>
</div>

<p>After Mason left Cave-in-Rock other outlaws still
continued to use the cavern as a temporary stopping
place or headquarters. An outlaw’s stay at any place is
of necessity short. Mason, in 1797, had lived there
longer than any other. Those who followed him were
more or less migratory. Residents in the vicinity were
in no way implicated in the various acts that made the
Cave so notoriously dangerous, until the mysterious
Ford’s Ferry band began its robberies. Since 1834,
when that organization ceased its operations, the Cave
has never been identified with outlawry.</p>

<p>To what extent James Ford, the owner of Ford’s
Ferry—a crossing place on the Ohio two and one-half
miles above the Cave—was connected with this organization
was not revealed in his day nor since, and it is
not at all likely that it will ever be determined. He is
more frequently discussed in tradition, and his life is
the subject of a greater variety of opinions than that of
any other man connected with the tragedies of the Cave-in-Rock
country. According to one version, “Jim Ford
was as black as some have painted him,” and, according
to another, his connection with the mysterious band had
the effect of preventing bad men from committing more
crimes than they would have if his influence had not
acted as a restraint.</p>

<p>A careful study of the few written records and the
many varied oral traditions pertaining to Ford, indicates
that when he reached the prime of life conditions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
had undergone many changes. Outlaws were no longer
in a position to carry on their depredations with the
freedom that attended the earlier days. Population
had increased, and with that increase came a better
reign of law. The line between law-abiding and law-breaking
citizens was rapidly widening. For about ten
years, ending in 1833, Ford apparently stood between
the two, and kept in close touch with both. By mingling
with the upright citizens he held in some measure
the respect of the community, and by acting as one of
the leaders of the highwaymen he reaped a share of
their booty. In serving the two opposing classes he
faced, and finally met, the fate common to such men.</p>

<p>His education and appearance, and his public activities,
gained for him the confidence of the community
and the standing of a trustworthy man, which he held
until toward the close of his life. Before he died many
of his fellow-citizens began regarding him with more
or less suspicion, and he soon became a man of mystery.
After his death his career was extensively discussed
throughout the lower Ohio valley. Our account
is confined principally to court records and oral traditions.
These old records, as far as known, have not
been cited heretofore by anyone attempting to tell the
story of James Ford.</p>

<p>Tradition has it that James Ford was born some time
during the latter part of the Revolution. His father,
it is said, was a Revolutionary soldier and moved with
his son to western Kentucky about 1803. Thus he appeared
in the Cave-in-Rock country about half a dozen
years after the Masons and Little Harpe had gone
south, but was living in the neighborhood when “Jim
Wilson” and some of the other outlaws were holding
forth at the Cave. His home was a half-mile southwest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
of what is now the village of Tolu, Crittenden County,
Kentucky. It was a mile from the Ohio and the head
of the notorious Hurricane Island, about eight miles
below Ford’s Ferry and five miles below Cave-in-Rock.
Ford owned a number of good farms in what was then
northern Livingston, now Crittenden County. So well
was he known along the lower Ohio that Samuel Cuming’s
<cite>Western Navigator</cite>, published in 1822, designates
the river landing near his home as “Major Ford’s.” The
old court records preserved at Smithland show that he
was a justice of the peace in 1815 and held the office a
number of times thereafter, and that practically every
suggestion made before the county court “on motion of
James Ford” was carried. He frequently served as
appraiser and administrator of estates. Through these
and other acts of trust he gained the prestige of a desirable
citizen. The improvement of roads was encouraged
by him, especially those leading to Ford’s Ferry.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting chapters of the mystery
surrounding Ford’s Ferry may be found in a book of
personal reminiscences and local traditions of Cave-in-Rock
and its vicinity disguised as historical fiction and
called <cite>Chronicles of a Kentucky Settlement</cite>. Its author,
William Courtney Watts, who possessed an excellent
education, was a very successful man of international
business experience, born at Smithland, Kentucky, near
Cave-in-Rock. Much of his information came directly
from his father and other pioneer settlers.</p>

<p>Among the men who figure in the romance, and
whom Watts personally knew, was Dr. Charles H.
Webb, of Livingston County, of which Smithland is
the seat. Dr. Webb married Cassandra Ford, the
daughter of James Ford. He related the story of his
life to Watts and thus contributed a chapter to history<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
that stands alone. There exists in more or less abundance
printed data relative to some of the methods employed
by the bands of robbers at Cave-in-Rock to
entice boats to land at the Cave and get possession of
victims. All these, however, are, as already observed,
stories based on statements made, not by men who spoke
from actual observation, but by persons who had heard
others relate another man’s experience. In Dr. Webb
we actually touch hands with a well-known and highly
respected citizen who was lured to the Cave by some of
the tricks suggested—tricks regarding which few lived
to tell the tale and of which nobody else left any direct
authoritative account.</p>

<p>Dr. Charles H. Webb and his brother John, both
young men, left South Carolina in 1822 for Philadelphia
and shortly thereafter set out for the West in
search of fortune, with St. Louis as their destination.
At Cave-in-Rock, on their way down the Ohio, they
met their great adventure and were separated as the
narrative records. Dr. Webb, having lost all, settled
at Salem. There he subsequently met and knew Watts.
The two became fast friends when Watts, much the
younger of the two, had grown up. It was from Dr.
Webb, in the flower of his middle age, that Watts had
this story:</p>

<p>“My brother and I descended the Ohio River from
Pittsburgh to Louisville in a flatboat, and after remaining
a few days in Louisville we again started on another
flatboat, intending to go on it as far as the mouth of the
Ohio River or near there.... The boat, a ‘broadhorn,’
was in charge of one Jonathan Lumley, who
owned a large proportion of the cargo which consisted
of corn, provisions, and whiskey. With Mr. Lumley
were three other stout young men as hands, making,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
with my brother and myself, who had agreed to work
our way for food and passage, six persons on board.</p>

<p>“Day after day as we floated along, the better I got
acquainted with my companions and the more I found
that, under a rough exterior, they were warm-hearted,
generous, and confiding fellows, equally ready for a jig
or a knock-down, for a shooting match or a drinking
bout, for a song or a sermon.</p>

<p>“I was playing on my flute as our boat was nearing
Cave-in-Rock, and when within full view of the high
rocky bluff, at the base of which is the entrance of the
Cave, we observed a woman on the top of the bluff hailing
us by waving a white cloth, whereupon our captain,
as we called Mr. Lumley, ordered us to pull in close to
shore, within easy speaking distance, so as to learn what
was wanted.</p>

<p>“Presently a man came from the entrance of the Cave,
and called out: ‘Hey, Cap! have you enny bacon or
whiskey on board?’</p>

<p>“‘I-yie!’ shouted back our captain.</p>

<p>“Won’t yer land? We’re short on rations here, an’
want ter buy right smart!’ said the man.</p>

<p>“‘Goin’ to the lower Mississippi!’ answered our captain,
‘and don’t want to break bulk so high up.’</p>

<p>“‘But, Cap, we’ud be mi’ty obleeged ef you’d lan’.
An’ we’ve got a woman here and a boy who want passage
down ter the mouth er Cumberlan’. They’ve bin
waitin’ a long time, an’ll pay passage.’</p>

<p>“‘All right then,’ replied the captain, ‘I’ll land; but
let them come aboard at once.’</p>

<p>“And land we did some two hundred yards below the
Cave, when the captain and three others—my brother
being one of them—went ashore and walked up to the
entrance. After waiting for more than an hour, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
none of our men returning, I asked my remaining
companion to go up to the Cave and see what was detaining
them. Another hour passed away; the sun had
gone down, and night, with clouds, was rapidly coming
on.</p>

<p>“I began to feel uneasy, and to add to my uneasiness,
a large dog which we had on board began howling most
dismally. Presently, by the dim twilight, I saw three
men approaching the boat from the Cave. At first I
thought them a part of our crew, but I was soon undeceived,
for they came on board, and with pistols drawn,
demanded my surrender. Resistance was useless; my
arms were soon bound behind my back, and I was told
that if I made any row my brains would be blown out.
I asked about my friends but was only told that they
were ‘all right,’ that the captain had ‘sold the boat and
cargo,’ and that what little information they had given
was ‘enough’ for me ‘to know.’</p>

<p>“I was then blindfolded, and when my money had
been taken from me, I was assisted—I should say lifted—into
a skiff, into which two of the three men, so I
thought, entered. I begged to know what had become
of my brother, and told them that he and I were passengers
on the boat and no part of the crew proper. I did
this hoping that if they knew we were passengers and
had no direct interest in the boat and cargo they would
think us less likely to return to the Cave and molest
them. But the only answer I got was that the ‘fewer
questions’ I asked the better it would be for me, ‘by a
d—— sight.’</p>

<p>“The skiff was then rowed away—in what direction I
could not tell, but in some five minutes there was a
pause in the rowing, and soon a slight jar as of two
skiffs coming together, followed by a conversation in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
low tones, the purport of which I could not catch.
Very soon, however, one of the men approached me and
whispered in my ear. There seemed to be a remnant of
mercy in the intonations of his words, rather than in the
words themselves. He said: ‘We’re goin’ ter vi’late
orders a little, an’ turn yer loose here in the middle er
the river. An’ the furder yer float away frum here ’fore
yer make enny noise, the better for yer by a d——
sight. Yer’d better lay low an’ keep dark till mornin’
comes.’ The speaker then slackened the cords that
bound my arms, after which he again whispered: ‘Yer
ken work ’em loose when we’re gone, say in ’bout an
hour, but not sooner, er yer may get inter trouble. An’
don’t yer never come back here to ax enny questions, or
yer’ll fare worse, an’ do nobody enny good.’</p>

<p>“The man then left me seated in the stern of the skiff,
and I could tell from the motion and the rattling of a
chain that a second boat was being pulled along side it,
into which the man stepped, leaving me alone. I
strained my ears to catch the slightest sound, but I could
neither hear the click of oars nor the dip of a paddle;
the latter, however, might have been used so noiselessly
as to be unheard. I was therefore in doubt. I thought
possibly the other boat might be floating close to me and
that I was being watched. This brought to my mind
the man’s caution not to try to free my arms for an
hour. I therefore, remained quiet for about that length
of time. No sound reached me except the moaning of
the night winds among the forest trees that lined each
shore, the occasional barking of wolves, and the weird
cry of night-fowls—particularly the blood-curdling
hooting of great owls....</p>

<p>“After a long and painful effort I succeeded in releasing
my arms and freeing my eyes from the bandage.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
Looking around I found the heavens overcast: the night
was so intensely dark that I could see only a dim outline
of the shore. I discovered there were neither oars nor
paddle in the skiff, but I was floating some two or three
miles an hour, and it might be many hours before I
would pass any habitation. I therefore made up my
mind to lie down in the skiff, try to get some sleep and
await the coming of morn. But the distant growling
thunder was creeping nearer and nearer; flash after
flash lit up the heavens, followed by almost deafening
discharges that rolled, crashed, and reverberated along
the river and among the forests, which moaned and
groaned under the pressure of the rising wind. The
waves in the river were momentarily increasing, and
were dashing my little skiff about in a way that was
alarming....</p>

<p>“I knew if the downpour continued for many minutes
my skiff would fill and sink. There was but one way to
bail it out—to use one of my thick leather shoes as a
scoop. I worked manfully while the rain lasted, which,
fortunately, was not for more than an hour.</p>

<p>“The long night finally passed, but the heavens were
still overcast. I peered along both banks—looked, hoping
to see smoke curling above some cabin chimney—but
there was no sign of human habitation. Occasionally
I raised my voice to its highest pitch—gave a loud
halloo—but no answering voice was returned. However,
about an hour later, I saw an island ahead of me;
it was evidently inhabited, for notwithstanding the
leaden aspect of the skies, I could see smoke ascending
from among the trees. I used my hands as paddles as
vigorously as I could so as to drift against the head of
the island, and in this I succeeded. Having secured
my boat, I soon found the cabin, and was kindly received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
by a Mr. Prior and his wife who gave me a good
breakfast. I told them of my misfortune, and they expressed
much sympathy for me. Mr. Prior, who seemed
to be an honest and intelligent man, told me that he
was one of the earliest settlers in those parts. He said
he had often heard of the depredations of the Wilson
gang about the Cave and that I was lucky to have escaped
with my life. He advised me to stop at Smithland,
at the mouth of the Cumberland River, where I
might obtain assistance and directions as to what was
best for me to do. Mr. Prior then made me a paddle
out of a clapboard, and bidding him and his kind wife
goodbye I returned to my skiff, pushed off, and that
evening arrived in Smithland.”</p>

<p>At Smithland young Webb was directed to Salem,
“which then contained a population, white and black,
of about two hundred and fifty.” There, in turn, he was
advised by Judge Dixon Given to consult Colonel Arthur
Love relative to the best method of gaining information
regarding his brother who had been captured
at the Cave. Colonel Love, a highly esteemed citizen,
lived a few miles from the home of James Ford, who
was suspected by many of being a leader of the Cave-in-Rock
band. No crime, however, had ever been
traced to Ford “with sufficient clearness to cause his
arrest and trial.” On his way to Colonel Love’s farm
Webb fell from his horse and sprained his ankle, and
it so happened that Cassandra Ford, daughter of James
Ford, found the helpless young man lying in the road.
She took him to her home, and he soon discovered he
was in the house of the very man he dreaded most.
But his fears rapidly vanished, for his rescuer had
become very much attached to him and he to her. He
was shown the flute of which he had been robbed near<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
the Cave. The mother and daughter revealed to him
the fact that they, like many of their neighbors, felt
somewhat suspicious that James Ford was, in some
way, connected with the notorious crowd at the Cave.
Ford, who was away from home much of his time, did
not return until about a week after the crippled man
was admitted. Then Webb saw “the masterful, self-willed,
dreaded, and almost outlawed man.” He gave
a description of him as he appeared at that time:</p>

<p>“He was about six feet in height, and of powerful
build, a perfect Hercules in point of strength; but he
has now grown too corpulent to undergo much fatigue.
His head is large and well shaped; his sandy brown
hair, now thin, is turning gray, for he must be fully
fifty years old; his eyes, of a steel-gray color, are brilliant
and his glance quick and penetrating; his nose
rather short and thick; his upper lip remarkably long,
his mouth large, and his lips full and sensuous. He
has a broad, firm, double chin, and his voice is deep and
sonorous. His complexion is very florid, and he converses
fluently. On the whole, when in repose, he gives
one the idea of a good natured, rather than a surly,
bulldog; but, if aroused, I should say he would be a
lion tamer.”</p>

<p>When Webb’s foot was sufficiently healed to permit
his leaving the Ford home he took his flute and crutches
and returned to Salem. Shortly thereafter he made the
first of his many calls on Miss Ford. In the meantime,
learning that his brother had been allowed to depart
from the Cave unhurt, he wrote letters to various places
and finally located him. Later he “went to Fort Massac
on a flatboat and from there walked to St. Louis,”
where he found his brother established in business. The
two spent several months together in the city and, according<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
to the story as related in <cite>Chronicles</cite>, it was
during his absence from Kentucky that Ford, the “almost
outlawed man,” passed beyond the reach of law.</p>

<p>It was at Ford’s Ferry that many emigrants going to
the Illinois country crossed the Ohio. In Ford’s day
the ferry at Shawneetown and another at Golconda also
were thriving and the three were, in a sense, rivals.</p>

<p>A river crossing with the reputation of having the
best roads leading to and from it was usually given the
preference. Ford, realizing this, placed sign-boards at
a number of road crossings, and cards in some of the
taverns, advertising the highway to his ferry. What
was known as the Ford’s Ferry Road extended, in
Kentucky, some eight miles south of the ferry and, in
Illinois, about twelve miles north of it. That part of it
in Kentucky running north from Pickering Hill to the
ferry, a distance of four miles, was well maintained by
the county through Ford’s influence. The road leading
from his ferry into Illinois was an equally important
one, but its condition depended solely upon his interest
and efforts in the matter. He attempted to persuade
the local authorities in Illinois to change the old Low
Water Road running through the bottoms to Pott’s
Hill, a distance of twelve miles, to one over higher
ground. Failing in this effort, he, at his own expense,
opened up a new road ever since known as Ford’s Ferry
High Water Road.</p>

<p>Thus with about twenty miles of comparatively good
road through a densely wooded country and with a first
class ferry, and by proper advertising, he succeeded, as
one man expressed it, “in having things come his way.”
Many people, it is true, were molested at the ferry and
along the highway leading to and from it; but such
misfortunes were then likely to befall any traveler at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
any place. If a robbery occurred along the Ford’s
Ferry Road, the news of the hold-up invariably ended
with the report that “Jim Ford found the robbers and
ran them out of the country.” And so, for many years,
the Ford’s Ferry Road and Ford’s Ferry maintained
the reputation of being “safe again.” In the meantime,
strangers continued to travel over it, and many fell into
the well-set trap.</p>

<p>At the foot of Pickering Hill, near Crooked Creek,
newcomers frequently met, as though by chance, some
“strangers” who explained that they were on their way
to Illinois. The unwary emigrants continued their
travel accompanied by persons who seemed honest men.
The “strangers” soon gained their confidence, and if,
by the time Ford’s Ferry was reached, the desirability
and possibility of a hold-up had not been ascertained,
the united party crossed over into Illinois. At Potts’
Hill, or before reaching that wayside tavern on the
south hillside, the newcomer was either robbed or permitted
to continue his journey unmolested. It is said
that many a traveler who was found weak and destitute
by the “strangers” was given money and other help by
them. On the other hand, the traveler who exhibited
evidence of wealth and prosperity almost invariably
met his fate along the road, at the ferry or at Potts’ Hill.</p>

<p>Billy Potts was the strategist on whom the highwaymen
relied as their last and best man to dispose of any
encouraging cases that had not been settled before they
reached his house. Potts, by one means or another, succeeded
in persuading the selected travelers to remain
all night at his inn. His log house was large and comfortable
and stood near a good spring which, then as
now, offered an abundant supply of water for man and
beast. Tradition says many a man took his last drink<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
at Potts’ Spring and spent his last hour on earth in
Potts’ house. Human bones are still turned up by plowmen
in the Potts’ Old Field, and since there is nothing
to indicate that they are the remains of Indians, the
conclusion is they represent some of the victims of the
mysterious Ford’s Ferry band. The log house occupied
by Billy Potts is still standing. Many years ago it was
converted into a barn. On its floor and walls there can
still be seen a number of large dark spots. Tradition
has it that they are stains made by human blood. Some
of the old citizens living in the neighborhood insist that
they are as distinct today as they were more than half a
century ago, notwithstanding the ravages of time.</p>

<p>There are many traditions of mysterious murders
attributed to the Ford’s Ferry highwaymen. Every one
is a fearsome tale and has evidently undergone many
changes since it was first told. Some seem to have more
versions than they are years old. None, so far as is
now known, can be verified by documentary or other
positive evidence. All these tales are apparently based
on facts but it is also evident that each is much colored
by fiction. A version of the tradition pertaining to
Billy Potts and his son is here retold:</p>

<p>A traveler was riding north on the Ford’s Ferry Road
one day, and after crossing the ferry was overtaken by
the son of Billy Potts. Young Potts expressed a delight
at having found a man with whom he could ride and
thus not only pass the time away more pleasantly, but
also travel with greater safety. After going a few miles
young Potts gained sufficient information to convince
him that the man was well worth robbing. When they
reached a point along the road where a hold-up could
be made with the least danger of exposure, Potts pulled
out his pistol, forced the man to throw up his hands and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
then proceeded to rob him. While Potts was in the
act of taking his victim’s money, two farmers living in
the neighborhood happened upon the scene. Not being
in sympathy with the gang of highwaymen and having
recognized young Potts, they informed others what they
had witnessed and reported the robbery to the authorities.
Ford, so runs the story, realizing that one of his
men had been detected and that much evidence could
be produced to convict the guilty one, advised him to
leave for parts unknown, and thus not only save himself
but also shield his confederates from further suspicion.
The young man left, and a few days later,
rumors emanating from the gang, to the effect that
young Potts had been driven out of the country by Jim
Ford, circulated freely. The disappearance of Potts
substantiated the report, and Ford received the credit
for ridding the community of an undesirable citizen.</p>

<p>Young Potts wandered around for several years, in
the meantime growing a beard and gaining in weight.
He evidently changed in appearance to such an extent
that he felt confident no one—not even his mother—would
recognize him, and that he could return home
without the least fear of detection. He reached Pickering
Hill on his homeward journey and there met a
number of “strangers” who informed him that they
were resting preparatory to resuming their travel to
the Illinois country. Potts recognized in these men his
old companions in crime, but none suspected who he
was. He rode with them to Ford’s Ferry, in the meantime
keeping the men in ignorance as to his identity.
When they reached the Ohio he saw that active preparations
were being made to rob him and, if necessary,
to murder him. He then revealed his identity. But it
was only after producing considerable proof that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
convinced the men that he was their long gone accomplice.
A great rejoicing followed.</p>

<p>Early in the evening young Potts started alone over
Ford’s High Water Road to his father’s house, where
he arrived shortly after dark. He found his father and
mother at home and, as he had anticipated, was not
recognized by them. He decided to attempt to conceal
his identity until late in the night, for he concluded that
if before making himself known he could impress his
father with the fact that his wandering boy had accumulated
money, the surprise which he was soon to give
him would be even greater. With this double surprise
in view, young Potts displayed a large roll of money
and whispered to his unsuspecting host that he knew
he was in a safe place for the night. The two men had
chatted in the candle lighted room for an hour or more,
when the guest asked for a drink of water. Out into the
dark they walked and down to the Potts Spring, a distance
of some three hundred feet. The young man getting
down on his knees, leaned over the rock-lined
spring. While in the act of drinking he was stabbed in
the back, under the left shoulder blade, and instantly
killed.</p>

<p>The murderer took the money from his victim’s
pocket, but failed to find anything to indicate who he
was, from where he came, or to what place he intended
to go. Old Potts dug a shallow grave and in it buried
all evidence of the crime. He returned to the house,
and after reporting to his wife that he had “made a
good haul,” retired for the night.</p>

<p>The next morning some of the Ford’s Ferry gang
rode to Potts’ Hill to celebrate the return of their friend.
Before they had an opportunity to explain the object
of their coming, Potts recited the details of how he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
disposed of an “easy” man the night preceding. One of
them then began the story of how they had met the
young fellow and how, when they were at the point of
carrying out their intention of robbing and killing him,
he made himself known and proved beyond doubt that
he was young Potts, their former associate. But before
the account was finished old Potts and his wife accused
the crowd of concocting this story and cursed the men
for plotting against them. But, persisting and giving
every detail of what happened during the time the
victim was in their presence, the men created doubt in
the minds of Potts and his wife, though Potts asserted
that in his opinion the man he had killed was not his
son, but perhaps a friend in whom his son had confided
to such an extent that he was able to convince them that
he was young Potts himself.</p>

<p>At this point of the discussion Mrs. Potts recalled
that her son had a small birthmark under one of his
shoulder blades, but which shoulder blade she could
not remember. Upon learning this, the men, hoping
to find such evidence as would convince the parents of
the identity of their son, repaired to the grave. It was
shallow and the soil loose. In a little while the body
was uncovered. Without waiting for it to be taken
from the grave, Potts bent forward and began to rip
the clothing from the corpse. The back showed no
mark on the right side. The bloody wound made by
the dagger that had pierced the heart was then examined.
It revealed the presence of the remembered
birth mark....</p>

<p>It was at Cave-in-Rock that the Ford’s Ferry band
met to discuss some of its plans and operations and to
divide the spoils. This rendezvous was two miles from
the road on which the highwaymen operated, and therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
sufficiently distant to avoid discovery by anyone
traveling over that land route. It was conveniently
reached by a boat from Hurricane Island or from
Ford’s Ferry. Furthermore, it was an ideal hiding
place in which to lie in wait for flatboats going down
the river.</p>

<p class="smaller">(From an original photograph made in 1917)</p></div></div>

<p>What went on at these meetings was never revealed
to any one not a member of the organization. The
tragic story of Billy Potts and his son is one of the few
secrets that leaked out, and it was not divulged until
long after Potts died and the organization had ceased
to exist. No arrests were made and for a long time no
local citizens were suspected; for, as already stated,
every reported robbery was soon followed by the news
that the crime had been committed by a traveling highwayman,
who had since been driven out of the country.</p>

<p>In time suspicion began to point toward a number of
local men whose incomes were out of proportion to
their labor, and whose frequent and long absences were
accounted for by them in contradictory ways. Vincent
B. Simpson, who lived on the Kentucky side of the
Ohio and ran the ferry boat at Ford’s Ferry, and Henry
C. Shouse, who lived on the Illinois shore at Cedar
Point almost opposite, were among those suspected of
being implicated in some of the depredations and were
regarded as two of the men responsible for the circulation
of counterfeit money. Both were apparently on
intimate terms with James Ford, whose two sons were
also suspected of being involved in some of the lawlessness
which was then increasing rapidly. Ford owned
Ford’s Ferry and the ferry house near it. The ferry,
however, was run by Simpson, who occupied the house.</p>

<p>After carefully concealing its acts for many years, the
clan began drifting to the inevitable. A lack of trust<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
among the men themselves and the increasing danger
of their work indicated that sooner or later something
would occur to end its career. The end came in 1834.
Strange to say, it was brought about, not through a dispute
over the division of spoils or a wholesale arrest of
its members, but was due more directly to a lawsuit
regarding a slave than to any other cause known to the
public. Tradition is vague regarding this litigation,
but the court records reveal sufficient data from which
to glean the cause of the beginning of the end of the
Ford’s Ferry mystery.</p>

<p>The Circuit Court Records of Livingston County
contain the proceedings of a suit entitled “Ford versus
Simpson” which began in September, 1829, and continued
nearly two years. James Ford’s petition recites
that on January 7, 1829, he bought from Vincent B.
Simpson a slave named Hiram, for the sum of eight
hundred dollars. Simpson guaranteed him to be “a
good blacksmith, sound and healthy,” but the negro
died soon after the sale, at the age of thirty-four. Ford
set forth that the man was “no blacksmith and no labourer
and was labouring under a disease called hernia,”
and that he was worth only two hundred and fifty
dollars at the time of the sale. In consequence of the
loss of time and work resulting from the purchase of
the negro, Ford sued for one thousand dollars damages.
Simpson tried, through various witnesses, to prove that
the slave was a good mechanic and a healthy negro, but
failed to establish any of his claims. Ford, on the other
hand, produced many men who upheld him and gave
much testimony to prove that Simpson had practiced a
fraud in making the sale. The case dragged through
the courts until March 9, 1831, when, by agreement of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
the attorneys, the suit was ordered dismissed, “each
party paying their own costs.”</p>

<p>This was a victory for Ford, for rumor had it that he
and Simpson were equally implicated in certain robberies.
Ford had proved Simpson a deceitful man and
could now cite the Hiram transaction as an example
of his unreliability. Ford was prepared, should Simpson
reveal any of their secrets and “try” to implicate
him; he was fortified against any accusation, true or
false, that Simpson might make. In the meantime,
Simpson continued to run Ford’s Ferry. Whether or
not Ford attempted to remove him is not known. It is
probable that each feared the other, and that each was
awaiting the other’s first damaging act. Ford and his
two grown sons evidently foresaw the possibility of
serious trouble.</p>

<p>These two sons were Philip and William M. Ford
(whose ages, in 1831, were respectively thirty-one and
twenty-eight years). He had one daughter, the Cassandra
who, February 5, 1827, married Dr. Charles H.
Webb, as previously noted. The daughter was an accomplished
and highly respected woman, and is so represented
in Watt’s <cite>Chronicles</cite>. Her husband was all
his life a model citizen. Ford’s first wife, it is said, was
a Miss Miles, whose brother at one time ran a ferry
where the village of Weston, Kentucky, now stands.
After the death of his first wife, Ford, January 15, 1829,
as shown by Livingston County marriage records, married
Mrs. Elizabeth Frazer, a widow with three daughters.
Mr. Frazer and his family, so runs the story, were
coming down the Ohio in a flatboat and chanced to stop
at Ford’s home. Mr. Frazer became ill while there,
and a few days later died. In the course of a short time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
Ford married the widow, and from that union was
born, in 1830, one child, James Ford Jr.</p>

<p>Trouble was brewing. What preparations were made
by Ford and his two sons to meet the uncertain developments
is not known. A perusal of the wills recorded in
Livingston County reveals the fact that Philip Ford
made a will on November 21, 1831, and that within
seven months thereafter wills were also made by his
brother and father. Philip Ford died two days after
he had prepared his will. One tradition has it that he
died of yellow fever, but that is not at all likely to be
true. The document was not recorded until June, 1833.
It shows he was a widower and a man of some means.
He designates his father and brother-in-law, Dr. Webb,
as administrators. He bequeathed some of his estate to
his father, sister, and brother William, but the greater
part to his only child, Francis Ford, then a small boy.
Among the items were seven slaves, two of whom,
“Irene, a woman, and Kitty, a girl,” were to be retained
and the other five sold “at nine months credit, the proceeds
to go for the whole use and benefit of my son.”
Another item reads: “My gold watch I wish Doct.
Charles H. Webb to take charge of until my son comes
of age and then to go to my son Francis Ford.” As requested
in this document, he was “buried by the side of
where my beloved wife is buried and in a decent manner.”
The inscription on his gravestone reads:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="smaller">“To the memory of Philip Ford who was born November 25th,
1800, departed this life November 23d, 1831.”</p></blockquote>

<p>A year later William died and was buried beside his
brother. Tradition ascribes his death to cholera. Be
that as it may, there is nothing to indicate that he “died
with his boots on,” although he might have met that
fate had he survived a few years longer. The graves of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
the two brothers are on the Ford Old Place about one
mile southwest of Tolu. Each is marked with a dressed
stone box grave cover, which, before the collapse a few
years ago, was about six feet long, three feet wide and
three feet high, the top being a well carved slab bearing
an inscription. The inscription on the grave of Ford’s
second son can be interpreted in more than one way:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="smaller">“To the memory of William M. Ford, who departed this life on
the 3d day of Novr. 1832, aged 28 years. Whose benevolence caused
the widow and orphant to smile and whose firmness caused his enemies
to tremble. He was much appresst while living and much
slandered since dead.”</p></blockquote>

<p>William also left a will. It is dated June 1, 1832.
The official records show that it was recorded July 27,
1832, a little more than three months before he died.
Tradition has forgotten how William’s “firmness caused
his enemies to tremble” and by what means he was
“much appresst while living and much slandered since
dead.” Nor is there any tradition regarding the
identity of the widows and orphans who, through his
benevolence, were caused to smile. His will, however,
throws some sidelights on his career as a father. The
document does not refer to a wife, living or dead. One
tradition has it that at the age of twenty-two he married
a girl by the name of Simpson, but that name does not
appear among the three mothers of his children referred
to by him. He first bequeaths all his estate to his
two sons, one of whom was, in 1832, seven years old,
and the other seven months. After stating the name of
the mother of each, he adds: “both of said children I
acknowledge to be my sons.” But in the event of the
death of both boys before they reached the age of
twenty-one, he gives two thousand dollars to the young
daughter of a certain woman he mentions, and bequeaths<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
practically all the residue of his estate to his
uncle, Richard Miles.</p>

<p>It is said that the inscription placed on the grave of
William was dictated by James Ford. Beginning a
short time before the death of his two sons, many accusations
against William and his father gained wide
circulation. Ford evidently hoped that such an inscription
on the tomb of the “appresst” and “slandered” son
would have the effect of a voice from the grave and do
much toward subduing undesirable true and false reports
that might continue to circulate after his death.
Tradition says James Ford requested his wife to place
an inscription of a similar character on his grave,
hoping it would, to a considerable extent, prevent the
community from attributing all the lawlessness to him
and none to the mysterious Ford’s Ferry band, of which
he was openly accused of being the leader. Mrs. Ford,
in all probability, would have carried out this wish had
she not died so soon after her husband. Be that as it
may, nothing marks the grave of James Ford nor that
of his wife. If small stones were erected over them
they have long ago disappeared, as have some of the
other headstones that once stood in the same graveyard.
The spot pointed out as the one where James Ford was
buried is a few feet from William’s grave and is now,
and long has been, covered by a briar patch.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_14">Paying the Penalty</h2>
</div>

<p>After the death of his two sons James Ford was, in a
sense, obliged to stand alone and face, as best he could,
any and all reflections upon his reputation. According
to one tradition, some of the law-abiding citizens continued
to regard him as an innocent victim of treacherous
associates. It appears that among the members of
the Ford’s Ferry crowd there were only a few whom he
dared trust. Henry C. Shouse was one of them and he,
with two others, as is shown later, played an important
part in the closing act of the mysterious band.</p>

<p>From the time of the lawsuit between Ford and
Simpson each lay perdu awaiting the action of the
other. Each realized, so runs the tradition, that the
other “knew too much.” One morning, shortly after
the death of Ford’s second son, Shouse approached
Simpson at Ford’s Ferry and tried to arouse the ferryman’s
anger and lead him into a fight. Simpson, suspecting
a hidden motive, quietly withdrew. A few
days later Shouse accused Simpson of treachery, claiming,
among other things, that Simpson had circulated
a report to the effect that “some one will soon turn
state’s evidence, and certain robbers, counterfeiters, and
murderers will then quit business for good.” A lively
fight followed; both men were badly bruised, but
neither was victorious.</p>

<p>Thus did Shouse, greatly influenced by others, make
and set his trap for Simpson. Simpson, sensing the
situation, immediately prepared for any defense that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
firearms might afford him. These strained relations
between the two men, each watching the other, continued
for about a week. On June 30, 1833, Simpson went
in his boat from Ford’s Ferry down to Cave-in-Rock
and, upon his return, stopped at Cedar Point and
walked up to the home of Shouse. Whether Simpson
had gone there to kill Shouse or to attempt to bring
about a reconciliation is an unsettled question. He had
reached a point in Shouse’s yard when, without warning,
some one, firing from the second story window of
Shouse’s log house, shot him in the back, inflicting a
wound of which he died next morning.</p>

<p>News that Simpson had been shot spread fast.
Shouse was, of course, immediately accused of the
murder. Those most familiar with the general state
of affairs suspected that James Mulligan and William
H. J. Stevenson, both of whom lived near by, were
accessories. A search was made in the neighborhood,
but not one of the three men could be found. The law-abiding
citizens on both sides of the Ohio recognized in
the death of Simpson the removal of a man who, either
through a selfish motive or for the good of the public,
contemplated revealing secrets the exposition of which
would have led to the extermination of a band of men
who had disturbed the community for many years.
Pursuing parties were sent out and messengers and letters
dispatched in every direction in an effort to capture
the three fleeing men and bring them back for
trial and punishment.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the situation and its causes were
taken under consideration by certain citizens not in any
of the posses. Most versions have it that a few days
after Simpson had been killed a small number of men
who chanced to gather at the home of his widow, took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
up, in secret, the question of avenging Simpson’s death.
It is said that no definite decision was reached by them,
but that each trusted the vengeance to fate itself. However,
three men were appointed to ride to Ford’s residence
and ask him to come to Simpson’s in order that
he might be prepared to join the crowd which was,
early the next morning, to appear before the grand jury
and give testimony as to the killing.</p>

<p>On their way the messengers met Ford near the Hurricane
Camp Ground. After hearing their mission he
stated he was then riding to the ferry to learn the latest
news and offer his services. The messengers, accompanied
by Ford, rode back to Simpson’s, where they arrived
about sundown. A few minutes later Ford and
a dozen or more men present were invited to take supper,
but all declined, apparently for the reason that
they were occupied discussing their plans for the next
day. After night had fallen the invitation was again
extended. About half the number then went into the
kitchen to eat, and the rest stood in the open passage
that ran between the two rooms of the log house. Ford,
accepting a chair, leaned it against the log wall and sat
down. The men, one by one, stepped out of the passage,
leaving Ford comfortably seated alone in the dark.
While in this position a man handed him a letter, in
the meantime standing to one side and holding a lighted
candle over Ford’s head, seemingly for the purpose of
throwing light on the paper. Ford was engaged in
reading the letter when someone concealed behind a
rose bush in the front yard, shot him through the heart,
the bullet lodging in the log wall against which he was
leaning. Ford fell on the floor dead. The body was
immediately carried out in the yard and preparations
were soon begun to send it to his home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
Placed in a rude box, on a wagon drawn by two oxen,
Ford’s body was taken to the Ford farm and there prepared
for burial, which took place a day or two later.
According to tradition, the only persons present at the
funeral were his wife, his daughter and her husband,
two of his neighbors and about half a dozen slaves. A
terrific storm suddenly came up while the little procession
was marching from the house to the family graveyard,
a distance of about a quarter of a mile. The
slaves were in the act of lowering the coffin when a
crash of thunder frightened one of them so badly that
he dropped the rope with which he was helping to
lower the corpse, and ran away. The head of the coffin
struck the bottom of the grave and wedged the box into
an angular position. Attempts were made to pry it to a
level, but without success. While the storm was raging
the remaining slaves, with all possible haste, filled the
grave. After completing the mound, these superstitious
negroes ran to their cabins and from that date “saw
things” that have not been seen since, but have entered
into many traditions pertaining to the Fords. For example:
Some of them <em>saw</em> “Jim Ford land in Hell head
foremost.”</p>

<p>The names of the man who held the candle and the
one who fired the shot that killed Ford were never
revealed, then or thereafter. It is said that no investigation
of the assassination was ever made, and, furthermore,
that if official proceedings had been attempted,
no evidence of any kind could have been procured.</p>

<p>Ford was suspected to be the leader, adviser, and
protector of the so-called Ford’s Ferry band, but
whether or not he was actually all these was never positively
proved. Had his wife lived a little longer, she in
all probability, would have carried out his suggestion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
to erect a monument over his grave. If so, the inscription
would have followed, more or less, the lines prepared
by him as his son William’s epitaph. There
would have been some truth in words to the effect that
James Ford had not only rendered much assistance to
widows and orphans, but also to the poor and destitute,
and that his “firmness caused his enemies to tremble.”
As to how he was “appresst while living” it is impossible
to determine now. That he was “much slandered
since dead” is true, judging from some of the tales told
about him even to this day.</p>

<p>One of these improbable stories is that Ford punished
a slave by placing the man’s head in a vise and while it
was thus fastened cut off the negro’s ears and pulled
out his teeth.</p>

<p>Another is to the effect that after the Ford’s Ferry
men had murdered and robbed a flatboatman they
learned from papers in his pocket that his name was
Simmons. They buried their victim on the hill near
the Ferry. Soon thereafter it was noticed that many
persimmon sprouts began to shoot up out of the grave
and the ground near by. Although grubbed out a number
of times they reappeared each succeeding spring.
Ford, seeing that the matter was viewed as an evil omen
and working on the superstition of some of his men,
ordered the remains taken up and ceremoniously lowered
into the river below Cave-in-Rock, “where,” as
one man expressed it, “Simmons couldn’t sprout any
more.” But the sprouts continued to sprout on the hill
overlooking Ford’s Ferry and today “the old ‘simmons
thicket” helps perpetuate this old tale.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
There is an absurd but widespread tradition that
James Ford had acquired, through his “frolics at the
ferry,” a vast fortune consisting of “dozens of farms,
hundreds of slaves, and barrels of money” and that in
his will he not only named every man connected with
the robber band, but gave each a slave or mule. This
story, like many of the others, is absolutely without
foundation. His will, recorded August 5, 1833, indicates
that he was not a man of more than ordinary
wealth. It was written in his own hand. It contains
many errors in composition and spelling and, like many
other early documents, is sparsely punctuated. It is
nevertheless evidence that his practical education was
far above most of his contemporaries, though his scholastic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
training was slight. His penmanship was good, as
can be seen by his signature here reproduced.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<div id="ip_313" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 10em;">
  <img src="images/i_313.png" width="151" height="58" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Jas. Ford</div></div>

<p>Tradition has it that Ford had been buried only a
few days when the report reached Ford’s Ferry that
Shouse, Mulligan, and Stevenson, who were accused of
having killed Simpson, had been overtaken. The three
had started for Texas, but were arrested in Arkansas.
Shortly after the guards and their charges started on
their return the captives tried to escape. Each prisoner
was then placed astride a horse and his feet tied under
the animal. In due time they were landed in the jail
at Equality, Illinois, then the county seat of Gallatin
County.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p>The court records show that the Gallatin County
grand jury at its September term, 1833, indicted Shouse
for the murder of Simpson, with Mulligan and Stevenson
named as accessories to the crime. The original indictment
is still preserved. The greater part of the
document is a repetition of old and verbose legal
phraseology, reciting what is summed up in the following
extracts:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
“That ... not having the fear of God before
their eyes, but being moved and seduced by the instigations
of the Devil on the thirtieth day of June ...
with force and arms ... in and upon one Vincent
B. Simpson, in (violation of) the peace of God and of
the people of the said State, feloniously, wilfully, and
of their malice aforethought, did make an assault, and
that the said Henry C. Shouse, with a certain gun called
a rifle, of the value of ten dollars, then and there
charged with gun powder and a leaden bullet ...
did shoot off and discharging said rifle gun, so loaded
... did wound the said Vincent in and upon
the left side of the back bone near the shoulder blade,
inflicting a mortal wound in and through the body ...
of which said mortal wound said Vincent did languish
and languishing did live until the first day of July ...
and of said mortal wound did die.... And that the
said James Mulligan and the said William H. J. Stevenson,
then and there, feloniously, wilfully, and of their
malice aforethought, were present, aiding, helping,
abetting, comforting, assisting, and maintaining the said
Henry C. Shouse, the felony murder aforesaid to do
and commit.”</p>

<p>A careful perusal of the court records and documents
leads to the discovery of these facts: The case was called
for trial a few days after the indictment had been found.
Fifteen witnesses had been summoned; all were ready
to give testimony for the state, but none for the defense.
After considerable discussion by the attorneys, a change
of venue to Pope County was granted, and the case was
docketed for trial at Golconda in November. Beginning
November 21, 1833, and continuing six days,
Shouse’s attorneys, Fowler and Gatewood, made every
effort to secure a postponement, claiming technical errors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
committed by the court. Failing in this, they presented
the fact that Mulligan had died in jail and Stevenson
had escaped, and on that ground succeeded in
deferring the trial until the May term following. There
is nothing to indicate the circumstances of the death of
the one, nor the escape and disappearance of the other.</p>

<p>On May 21, 1834, the case was again presented and
the attorneys argued for further delay, but failed.
Shouse stood trial, and after a two days’ hearing the
jury was instructed to consider the evidence. There is
nothing in the written records showing for what motive
Shouse killed Simpson. In fact, the records contain
little other than stereotyped legal phrases relative to
postponing the case. They throw practically no light
on the evidence heard. No summaries of the testimony
have been found. Shouse denied his guilt. The name
of Ford does not appear in any of the documents. Tradition
says that Shouse not only did not betray Ford,
but shielded him whenever an opportunity presented
itself.</p>

<p>After the jury had retired, one William Sharp appeared
on the scene and begged to be heard. Shouse’s
attorneys prepared a written avowal of what Sharp’s
statement would contain and presented it to the judge
with an argument that in view of the new evidence by
a material witness the case be retried, regardless of the
verdict of the present jury. This was overruled. This
document is the only one from which can be gathered
any suggestion as to the character of evidence probably
employed by the defense. Its plea was that “Shouse
expects to prove by said witness (Sharp) that the deceased
Simpson told him about a week before his
death that he had some short time before collared the
defendant Shouse and dared him to cut, that he intended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
then in a few days to take his pistol and go over
to Shouse’s house and settle him.” This was a plea of
self-defense. But, as already stated, this motion was
overruled. The jury, after due deliberation, found
Shouse “guilty as charged.”</p>

<p>According to most traditions, Simpson had more
knowledge of the criminal conduct of the Ford’s Ferry
outlaws than it was safe for one man to have. It was
rumored that a large reward was about to be offered for
evidence leading to the conviction of any member of
the band, and Simpson’s confederates feared he would
be tempted to betray them. Shouse, it seems, was
selected—or volunteered—to see that “dead men tell no
tales.”</p>

<p>No man of his time was more familiar with the details
of the Shouse murder trial than William Courtney
Watts. He furnished the following statement to a
representative of the Louisville <cite>Courier-Journal</cite> which
published it March 27, 1895:</p>

<p>“Shouse was one of the ring-leaders of the notorious
Ford gang and it is generally believed that Ford deputized
him to kill Simpson. It was observed that after
Shouse was sentenced to be hanged, his attorney, Judge
Wyley P. Fowler, spent a large part of his time in the
cell of Shouse. It finally leaked out that Shouse was
dictating to Judge Fowler a history of the robber band
to which he had belonged and that his statements implicated
some of the wealthiest and most prominent citizens
in Livingston County. At that juncture Judge
Fowler received a number of anonymous letters in
which writers threatened his life in the event of his
ever making public the communications made to him
by Shouse. By the advice of friends Judge Fowler
spent the succeeding winter in Frankfort. Upon his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
return Mr. J. W. Cade, the circuit clerk, asked Judge
Fowler if the Shouse history had been destroyed. He
replied: ‘No good could come of its publication. It
would cast a shade upon the reputation of some of
Livingston County’s most esteemed citizens.’ Nothing
further was ever heard of the manuscript and it is believed
that Judge Fowler destroyed it.”</p>

<p>It is said Judge Fowler’s notes were based on the
dictations the doomed Shouse intended for the public,
and on such reports as were being openly discussed
among the people. Judge Fowler, however, having
been Ford’s attorney for a number of years and having
represented Shouse in his last trial, recognized that any
statement he made would be considered as based on
confidential information received by him as an attorney,
and that, in consequence, he would be unjustly condemned.</p>

<p>What Shouse’s history and confession contained was
the subject of much speculation for a generation or two.
There is an impression among some people living in the
lower Ohio River valley that Judge Fowler’s alleged
manuscript on the history of the robber band still exists.
Inquiry recently made among his descendants resulted
in learning that many years before his death in 1880,
he, in the presence of an intimate friend, destroyed all
his data on the subject. Judge Fowler never permitted
any one to see his notes and seldom discussed the matter.
It is said that on one occasion when he was asked
whether or not the Ford’s Ferry band was a branch of
the clan led by John A. Murrell, he left the impression
that it had at one time made some preparations to work
in conjunction with the great western land pirate and
his band of negro stealers.</p>

<p>More or less has been written by historians and novelists<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
about John A. Murrell, but no writer connects
him with Cave-in-Rock or Ford’s Ferry. <cite>The History
of Virgil A. Stewart</cite>, a book on the life of Murrell,
compiled by H. R. Howard and published in 1836,
gives an incomplete list of Murrell’s associates. Among
the four hundred and fifty names there recorded there
is none familiar to persons now living near Cave-in-Rock.
Tradition says that Shouse made a few trips
between the Cave and Marked Tree, Arkansas, to meet
Murrell or some of his representatives for the purpose
of delivering and receiving messages pertaining to negro
stealing and the disposition of counterfeit money.
But whether or not the Ford’s Ferry band was ever part
of the John A. Murrell clan will remain, in all probability,
one of the Ford’s Ferry mysteries.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p>On June 7, 1834, Judge Thomas C. Brown sent a writ
to Joshua Howard, Sheriff of Pope County: “Whereas
... Judgment hath been given in our said
court that the said Henry C. Shouse shall be hanged by
the neck until he is dead and that execution of said
judgment be made and done on Monday the ninth day
of June <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span>, 1834, between the hours of twelve of the
clock at noon and four of the clock in the evening of
the same day, at some convenient place in the vicinity,
not more than one-half mile from the town of Golconda
in said county, in the usual manner of inflicting punishment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
in such cases....” And on June 9 Shouse paid
the extreme penalty.</p>

<p>Tradition has it that on the day of the hanging
thousands of people came to Golconda from Gallatin
and Pope counties, Illinois, and from Livingston County,
Kentucky, and other sections, to see the first legal
hanging in the county and to witness the death struggle
of a Ford’s Ferry and Cave-in-Rock outlaw. Even to
this day, a large crowd in that section of the country is
measured as being “as big as the one when Shouse was
hanged.” The execution took place in the creek bottom
immediately north of the town limits, at a spot
where the slopes of the hills converge to form a natural
amphitheatre. About two o’clock in the afternoon
Shouse was placed on an ox-cart and driven to the
scaffold that had been built by erecting two heavy
timbers with a cross beam over them. Between these
two upright posts the cart was placed, and into it the
condemned man’s coffin was then shoved, thus serving
the purpose of a platform and trap. Shouse’s hands
were tied behind his back; he was blindfolded and
made to stand erect upon his coffin. The suspended
rope was looped around his neck; the oxen pulled the
cart forward and Shouse fell.</p>

<p>Thus terminated the career of one of the members of
the mysterious Ford’s Ferry band, and with it passed
away forever bloodshed and robbery at Cave-in-Rock.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="hdr_15">The Cave in Fiction</h2>
</div>

<p>Historical novels, with some exceptions, present the
past in a more interesting manner than do the formal
histories which are intended as chronicles of actual
facts. It has been said, on the one hand, that “truth is
stranger than fiction,” and on the other that “fiction is
often more truthful than fact.” Fiction is undoubtedly
more truthful in the presentation of the manners and
social life of the period portrayed than is formal history.
The history of Cave-in-Rock and the careers of
the outlaws identified with the place is not only stranger
than fiction, but is besprinkled with many tragic and
melodramatic scenes which, although almost unimaginable,
are actually true. For more than a century fiction
writers have used the Cave as a background for stories.
These authors by freely discarding the leading facts
and drawing on their own imaginations wrote stories
less original than might otherwise have been produced.</p>

<p>No effort has been made to compile a more or less
complete collection of works of fiction pertaining to the
Cave. The stories and poems commented on in the
course of this chapter are only such as were incidentally
found while in search of history. Although this fiction
has very little of facts for a basis, and most of the
scenes are far from probable, nevertheless it necessarily
stands not only as Cave-in-Rock literature, but also as
a contribution to the good, bad, or indifferent literature
of America. The fact that more than one edition was
published of the Cave-in-Rock novels here referred to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
indicates, to some extent that they represent some of the
types of stories then in demand.</p>

<p>Stories dealing with mysterious murders and highway
robberies have always found many enthusiastic
readers. It seems that every decade of the nineteenth
century produced at least one new tale of Cave-in-Rock.
And in our own times the writings of some well-known
living authors show that the Cave is still supplying material
for fiction.</p>

<p>In Irvin S. Cobb’s story “The Dogged Under Dog,”
(originally published in the <cite>Saturday Evening Post</cite>,
August 3, 1912, and shortly thereafter printed in Cobb’s
book entitled <cite>Back Home</cite>) one of the characters, recalling
some of the rough men who lived near the Cave
when that country was still new, says Big Harpe and
Little Harpe were run down by dogs and killed and
that “the men who killed them cut off their heads and
salted them down and packed them both in a piggin
of brine, and sent the piggin by a man on horseback
up to Frankfort to collect the reward.”</p>

<p>Nancy Huston Banks in <cite>Oldfield</cite>, 1902, devotes a few
pages to Cave-in-Rock, the Harpes, and a character she
calls “Alvarado,” a mysterious Spaniard who frequented
the lower Ohio valley and who was suspected
of having been a comrade of Jean Lafitte. Mrs.
Banks, in her next historical novel, <cite>’Round Anvil Rock</cite>,
1903 (in which Philip Alston is one of the leading
characters) refers to that section of Kentucky lying opposite
the Cave as having been the “Rogues Harbor.”</p>

<p>The Harpes, Masons, and the Cave are introduced in
<cite>The Ark of 1803</cite>, by C. A. Stephens. This book for
boys, published in 1904, is intended as a picture of
romances and tragedies incidental to early navigation
on the Ohio and Mississippi. It serves that purpose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
fairly well, although practically no statement made by
the author regarding the Harpes and the Masons is in
accordance with history or tradition.</p>

<p class="smaller">It shows a landscape interesting in itself but false to the actual scene</p>

<p class="smaller">(Reproduced from Charles Bodmer’s drawing)</p></div></div>

<p>Our earliest item relative to fiction pertaining to the
Cave was found in a review published in <cite>The Port Folio</cite>,
February, 1809, of Thomas Ashe’s <cite>Travels in
America Performed in 1806</cite>, printed in London in
1808. The critics in Ashe’s day, and ever since, declared
the writer of <cite>Travels</cite> a literary thief, bone thief,
and infamous prevaricator and ridiculed his work on
the ground that it was filled with incredible stories
grafted onto authentic incidents and actual facts. This
general condemnation gave the new book a wide circulation
for a few years. The editor of <cite>The Port Folio</cite>
devotes a dozen pages to his “entire contempt both of
Mr. Ashe and his work.”</p>

<p>Most of the travelers who appeared after Ashe’s day
and examined the Cave detected in his sketch a combination
of facts and fiction that helped spread the name
and history of this interesting and picturesque rendezvous
of outlaws. Many a visitor still goes to the place
expecting to explore the “upper cave” but soon discovers
that its size has been wildly exaggerated by Ashe.
His account of the Cave is one of the longest ever written
and will always be of curious interest no matter
from what standpoint it may be read, other than history.
The reproach to Ashe is that he gave the hoax out as
veritable facts encountered in his travels and never
corrected this impression or acknowledged his purpose.
About half of what he says concerning the Cave is at
least highly probable; the remainder is wholly fictitious.</p>

<p>A casual investigation of the stories published after
outlawry terminated at Ford’s Ferry, brought to light<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
two novels and a long poem in which the Cave serves
as a background. Viewed from the standpoint of today
their plots have the consistency of a dime novel. Browsing
in the field of fiction also led to the discovery of the
one time celebrated romance of <cite>Harpe’s Head</cite>.</p>

<p><cite>Harpe’s Head</cite>, by Judge James Hall, was first published
in America in 1833, and the following year was
printed in London under the title of <cite>Kentucky, A Tale</cite>.
It was later republished in America in Judge Hall’s
volume, <cite>Legends of the West</cite>. <cite>Harpe’s Head</cite> is the
only novel in which the notorious Harpes are introduced
as characters. It is a story of a small emigrant
family traveling from Virginia to western Kentucky
over the route then endangered by the Harpes. All the
characters are fictitious, except the two outlaws and
their wives. No reference is made to their career at the
Cave.</p>

<p>The romance is written in a dignified and graceful
style. <cite>Atkinson’s Casket</cite> for November, 1833, in its
comments on the book says “it has some masterly
scenes,” and quotes one in full—a Virginia barbecue.
Among other interesting sketches of pioneer times
woven into <cite>Harpe’s Head</cite> is one of “Hercules Short”
or “Hark Short, the Snake Killer,” a half-witted boy
who performs extraordinary feats and who labors under
the impression that he is a son of Big Harpe. On one
occasion “Hark” remarks that his mother told him, “If
anybody was to rake hell with a fine-comb they would
not find sich a tarnal villain as Big Harpe.”</p>

<p>Edmund L. Starling, in his <cite>History of Henderson
County, Kentucky</cite>, 1887, says: “The history of the
Harpes in this portion of Kentucky, has long ago, and
repeatedly found its way into the histories of Kentucky
and other states, in pamphlets and the newspapers of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
the country, and at one time was even dramatized for
the American stage. But it was so desperate and appalling
to all rational sensibilities that it was abandoned by
the drama.” I did not find any pamphlets or dramas
regarding the Harpes.</p>

<p>The earliest novel found using Cave-in-Rock for a
background is <cite>Mike Fink, A Legend of the Ohio</cite>, by
Emerson Bennett, who for a time was a well-known
writer of thrilling romances. This melodrama was first
published in Cincinnati in 1848, and although now a
somewhat rare book, it ranked, judging from the number
of editions issued, among widely-read stories of the
middle of the last century. Its popularity was not due
to any high literary merit, but to its wild and extravagant
plot. The greater part of the story deals with
bloody battles between a band of outlaws and the flatboat
crew and passengers led by Mike Fink. Practically
all the action takes place in or near the Cave, and
for that reason “A Legend of Cave-in-Rock” would
have been a more appropriate subtitle.</p>

<p>Shortly after <cite>Mike Fink</cite> was put into circulation
there appeared in the <i>Alton</i> (Illinois) <cite>Courier</cite>, 1852, a
prize serial entitled <cite>Virginia Rose</cite>, by Dr. Edward
Reynolds Roe. Having gone through a pamphlet edition,
this Cave-in-Rock story was published in book
form in 1882 under the title of <cite>Brought to Bay</cite>, and in
1892 the same story was republished and its title
changed back to <cite>Virginia Rose</cite>. Dr. E. R. Roe—not
E. P. Roe with whom he is sometimes confused—was a
citizen of Illinois, practiced medicine and wrote a number
of books. He died in Chicago in 1893 at the age of
eighty. He lived in Shawneetown a few years, beginning
in 1843, and it is said he prepared the greater part
of this manuscript while residing there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
The book has no preface and the presumption is that
all the characters are fictitious. The story deals with
the career of a girl, Virginia Rose, who was kidnapped
in Shawneetown by her father, the leader of the Cave-in-Rock
outlaws. He takes her to the Cave, and it so
happened that shortly thereafter the New Madrid
earthquake of 1811 occurs. The citizens of Shawneetown,
suspecting that the stolen Virginia Rose may have
been taken to the Cave, so runs the story, organize a rescuing
party. Upon their arrival at the Cave, they, to
their great surprise, find the place abandoned. Boxes
and barrels were scattered around, their contents undisturbed,
and the general appearance indicated that the
place had been abandoned suddenly.</p>

<p>In the words of the author: “Remnants of a feast
which had never been eaten were lying upon a table;
lamps were hanging around burnt out for want of
oil.... The hatchway overhead, which communicated
with the room above was not closed ... but
the avenues which led from it to the inner cave had disappeared.
The rock had fallen from above in vast
masses and closed all connection between the upper
cave and the outer world forever.... What was a
hill back of the cave bluff now appeared to be a hollow
or depression, as compared to the ground around it....
The outlaws had met their fate—they had perished in
the earthquake [except the leader and his daughter
who were on the Mississippi at the time] perhaps in the
midst of gay festivities, perhaps in the hour of music
and dancing! Who could say? Not a soul was left to
tell the tale. The men who had come to execute vengeance
could not now avoid sympathy for the dead.”</p>

<p>Thus did the author of <cite>Virginia Rose</cite> make the New
Madrid earthquake wipe out the Cave-in-Rock’s “inner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
cave” or “upper cave” that had been “discovered” and
is so extravagantly described by Thomas Ashe!</p>

<p>Between recorded history on the one hand and stories
of fiction on the other stands the book <cite>Chronicles of a
Kentucky Settlement</cite>, 1897, by William Courtney
Watts. It is a historical romance based solely on local
tradition. Although this work is somewhat faulty in
its general construction, and may be, at times, somewhat
crude in its literary style, it is, nevertheless, one of the
most faithful historical sketches of early Kentucky.</p>

<p>The leading characters are Joseph Watts and Lucinda
Haynes, who were first thrown together in 1805
when children on their way from North Carolina to
the West, Joseph going to Tennessee and Lucinda moving
with her parents to Kentucky. A few years later
Joseph Watts began a search for Miss Haynes and
found her near Salem, Kentucky. After a courtship
such as none but lovers in a new country could experience,
they were married and became the parents of the
author who tells their story. Among other characters
is Charles H. Webb, who gave Watts an account of his
capture at Cave-in-Rock and escape from the outlaws
and who later married the daughter of James Ford.</p>

<p>The gloomiest tragedy in the book concerns the unfortunate
Lucy Jefferson Lewis, sister of Thomas Jefferson,
whose two sons killed a slave on their farm near
Smithland, Kentucky, and cut up the body in an attempt
to conceal their crime. One of the Lewis brothers
committed suicide on his mother’s grave and the other
escaped after he had been arrested for murder and
placed in jail. All the characters in <cite>Chronicles</cite> are presented
under fictitious names.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<p>It is probable that every person who saw the landscape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
of which the opening of the Cave forms a part
had his sense of romance and poetry stirred by the sight.
To what extent attempts were made to express this
emotion in the form of poetry or verse is not known.
Only one poem has been found—“The Outlaw,” by
Charles H. Jones, of Cincinnati. It comprises about
one thousand two hundred lines, published in 1835 in a
neatly bound booklet called <cite>The Outlaw and Other
Poems</cite>. In the October, 1835, issue of the <cite>Western
Monthly Magazine</cite>, of Cincinnati, Judge James Hall
devotes two pages to a eulogistic review of the book,
encouraging the young poet in his work. A more enthusiastic
reviewer might have called this an epic of
Cave-in-Rock.</p>

<p>In his introductory note Mr. Jones briefly refers to the
then well-known fact that the Cave had been for many
years the resort of a band of outlaws all of whom were
finally either killed or driven out by the Rangers. As
to his authorities he states that “the ravages of the robbers
are still fresh in the recollection of many of the inhabitants
of the lower Ohio valley.”</p>

<p>About one-half of the poem is an “effervescence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
poetic fancy,” with here and there a real gem. The
plot is dramatic. The story begins in Virginia. Our
hero shoots his successful rival in love immediately
after the wedding ceremony. Believing he has killed
the groom and that the shock has proven fatal to the
bride, he flees to the wilds of the West. He drifts down
the Ohio, joins the band of outlaws at the Cave and
soon becomes their leader—The Outlaw.</p>

<p>One “dark tempestuous night” a flatboat passing the
Cave is attacked by the robbers; a fierce and bloody
combat follows. The Outlaw discovers among the passengers
the very girl who had discarded him for another—and
still alive. He stabs her in the heart and
<span class="locked">then—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“He raised her body from the floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And hurled it to the foaming wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her white robe red with streaming gore,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A fitting shroud for such a grave.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The battle continues. The Outlaw kills man after
man, when to his surprise he finds himself facing the
very man he thought he had killed in Virginia. The
two recognize each other instantly. They draw daggers
and The Outlaw is slain. And the boatmen, so runs the
story, exterminate the band of robbers at the Cave.</p>

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> Charles Alexander Lesueur (1778–1857) French naturalist and artist,
was a member of Robert Dale Owen’s communal colony at New Harmony,
Indiana, forty miles northeast of the cave. His drawing of Cave-in-Rock has
never been published except in a doctoral thesis by Mme. Adrien Loir
entitled, <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Charles Alexandre Lesueur, artiste et savant Français en Amérique
de 1816 a 1839</cite>; issued in 1920 by Museum d’Histoire Naturelle, Le Havre.
In this thesis are reproduced forty of Lesueur’s drawings.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> The first, and in a sense the only standard guide book of this kind ever
published, was Zadok Cramer’s <cite>The Ohio and Mississippi Navigator</cite>. It
made its appearance about 1801 and was followed by a number of revised
and enlarged editions until 1824, when the last edition was printed. It was
practically the only printed guide for flatboats.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> Conflict with pirates, cut-throats, and counterfeiters was only one of the
perils to which the boatmen were exposed on their long and trying trips into
the western wilds. Floating ice, heavy winds and rains, treacherous currents,
hidden bars, and large snags were among the natural dangers that
constantly engaged the attention of the steersman. Many boats, managed by
careless or inexperienced men, were overturned, the craft and cargo damaged
or lost, and, as was frequently the case, some or all on board drowned.
Poorly constructed boats were put out of commission after meeting with
only a few minor obstacles.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> Prior to about 1824 Harpe was spelled Harp.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> After killing Langford the Harpes probably continued to travel along
the Wilderness Road until they reached Crab Orchard, from which place
radiated, besides the Wilderness Road to Cumberland Gap, at least four
other routes: the Louisville route, the Frankfort and Cincinnati route, passing
Logan’s Fort (or Stanford) Danville, and Harrodsburg, the Maysville
route, and the Tennessee route. Crab Orchard, being a converging point of
roads, many travelers going east waited there until a crowd of a dozen or
more was organized, thus assuring each a greater safety in making the trip
through the Wilderness. Settlers passing through the Wilderness going
west usually left home in a crowd sufficiently large to protect itself. [<a href="#B123">123</a>]
Langford, as is shown later, met the five Harpes in the Wilderness and,
notwithstanding their appearance, he doubtless felt that they would at least
serve as protection in the event of danger. The Harpes, after killing Langford,
probably passed through Crab Orchard and continued northwest via
the Frankfort road, toward Stanford and in or near Stanford turned west
for the purpose of misleading anyone who might pursue them as that course
threw them toward both Tennessee and western Kentucky.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> In 1799 Stanford was a frontier settlement of less than 200 persons,
including slaves. In 1780, when Lincoln County was formed, Logan’s Fort
or St. Asaph’s became the seat of justice. In 1787 (on land presented by
Colonel Benjamin Logan, a site about half a mile east of the fort, where the
brick court house now stands) the county erected a log court house thirty
feet long and twenty feet wide, with a small jury room on each side, the
structure forming a T. Near it stood a log jail of two rooms, each twelve
feet square.[<a href="#B28">28</a>] In these log buildings the Harpes were tried and confined.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> A perusal of the accounts kept by Joseph Welsh, the sheriff of Lincoln
County, reveals many interesting facts. John Gower against the Commonwealth
of Kentucky runs: “For making a pair of handcuffs for Wiley Roberts
9s. And putting on and taking off when committed and before trial 2s. 6d.
To putting on and taking off the handcuffs after trial and before removal to
the District jail 2s. 6d.,” making a total of 14s. For this same service on
Micajah Roberts, Gower received, respectively 2s. 6d., 1s. 3d., and 1s. 3d.,
a total of only 5s.
</p>
<p>
The sheriff received the following sums: “For summoning a court for the
examination” of the five prisoners, £1. 5s. “For summoning twelve witnesses
vs. Micajah Roberts and others, at 1s. 3d. each, 15s.” “For imprisoning,
2s. 6d., keeping in jail 10 days at 1s. a day, 10s., Removing to District
jail, 7s. 6d., total 20s.,” making a total of £5.
</p>
<p>
Another bill presented by the sheriff was for eight men guarding the five
prisoners in the Lincoln County jail for fourteen days at 4s. 6d. each per
day, making a total of £25. 4s. The last bill shows he paid seven of the
guards “for one day and traveling twenty miles in removing the above
prisoners to the District jail and returning at 2d. per mile, 6s. 4d. [sic]”
making a total of £2. 4s. 4d.
</p>
<p>
The total of all these accounts is a little more than £35. or what would
today be about $175.00.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> Danville, in 1799, with a population of a little over 200, was one of the
most important towns in Kentucky. In 1784 the court authorized the building
of “a log house large enough for a court room in one end, and two jury
rooms in the other end on the same floor ... and a prison of hewed or
sawed logs at least nine inches thick.” [<a href="#B82">82</a>] The buildings were still in use
when the Harpes were taken there to await trial.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> The account of the Danville jailer shows that the two men had been
confined 71 days, Sally and Betsey 102 days, and Susanna 103 days, for
which a charge of 1s. per day for each was made; 449 days £22. 9s. In the
same record is a memorandum to the effect that the three infants had been in
jail 69, 43, and 9 days, or a total of 121 days. The jailer evidently intended
to make a charge for this item, but there are no figures to indicate the contemplated
amount. Four men for guarding the jail 103 days received a total
of £6. 6s. An item shows: “April 12, 21¾ cords wood from the 5th of
January until this day for the use of guards, court, and prisoners @ 6 [sic]
cutting the wood for the above, 2s. 6d., £2. 14s. 4d.” The total of the three
items is £31. 9s. 4d. The seven Danville items previously noted amount to
£5. 7s. 11d. This makes the Danville expense a grand total of £36. 17s. 3d.,
or what would today be about $185.00. This, with the $175.00 Stanford
account makes a grand total of the now known expense items a sum that
would today be about $360.00.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> A special act of the Kentucky legislature was passed and approved
December 18, 1800, for the relief of the widow of John Tully, extending the
statutory time of payment for lands taken up by him on the south side of
Green River under a settlement act and exempting her in the interval from
paying interest. The extension was given until December 1, 1810. The
preamble of the act recites its enactment because “Tully ... having obtained
a certificate for a settlement of two hundred acres of land ... having
settled on said land, was assassinated by the murderers called Harpes, and
consequently left his wife, Christiana Tully, a desolate widow with eight
small children.” This is a notable instance of pioneer liberality and sympathy
for a widow in distress, particularly in spite of the fact that, according
to Colonel Trabue, Tully not only knew the Harpes, but also, less than a
year before they murdered him, had carried messages to them from the
Harpe women when the outlaws were making for Cave-in-Rock.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> Tradition says Major William Love’s charred corpse was buried near
the site of the Stegall house. His widow survived him many years and is
buried at Piney Fork Camp Ground, about six miles east of Marion, Kentucky.
On the marble slab at the head of her grave is the inscription: “My
name was Esther Love, daughter of Wm. &amp; Nancy Calhoun of Abbeville,
South Carolina, born Sept. 30, 1765, died Mar. 2, 1844. My husband Wm.
Love was killed by the Harpes Aug. 1799. Blessed are the dead which die
in the Lord.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> Draper in his “Sketch of the Harpes” places Big Harpe’s head “in the
forks of a tree,” but in a later note [<a href="#B12G">12G</a>] he has it “placed or rather stuck
on the sharpened end of the limb of a tree.” Breazeale has it “upon the top
of a lofty pole, or in the fork of a tree.” Collins, in one version, says the
men “stuck it upon a pole where the road crosses the creek,” and in another,
that “a tall young tree, growing by the side of the trail or road, was selected
and trimmed of its lateral branches to its top, and then made sharp. On
this point the head was fastened. The skull and jaw-bones remained there
for many years—after all else had been decomposed and mingled with the
dust.” In his sketch on Webster County, Kentucky, Collins states that “Big
Harpe’s head was stuck upon a pole” near an oak tree which was still standing,
and that the letters H.H. for Harpe’s Head, carved upon it in 1799,
were still legible in 1874.
</p>
<p>
Robert Triplett, in his anonymous autobiography, <cite>Roland Trevor</cite>, publishes
an absurd story to the effect that the two Harpes had stolen the
daughter of a pioneer living near Henderson. The father pursued Big
Harpe, wounded him, and shortly thereafter captured him. This confused
and confusing writer says: “Harpe lay near a tree. The father lifted him,
and set him up against it, and then went a little way to a branch, from
which, in the brim of his hat, he carried Harpe some water, and while he
was drinking reloaded his rifle, and shot him. Then with his knife he cut
off his head and stuck it on a pole at the fork of the road between Henderson
and Madisonville, which place, from that circumstance, was called, and is
to this day, ‘Harpe’s Head.’”
</p>
<p>
Another absurd story of the Harpes appears in <cite>History of Great American
Crimes</cite>, by Frank Triplett who with a few facts and a vivid imagination
succeeds in covering some twenty pages on the Harpes. According to his
account, Leiper and Stegall organized a pursuing party, and when the
wounded outlaw was overtaken one end of a rope was adjusted around Big
Harpe’s neck and the other thrown over a limb of a large tree under which
the wounded man lay. “Appalled by the blasphemies of Harpe, the word
was given, and, with a strong pull, his body was run up some six or eight
feet from the ground, and whirling round and round in the rapidly gathering
twilight, it quivered convulsively for some moments; there was a fierce death
struggle and the soul of the most demoniac murderer that ever cursed our
continent had gone out into the limitless realms of eternity. When satisfied
that Harpe was dead, the corpse was lowered to the ground, the head cut off
and fixed in the fork of the tree which had served his executioners as a
gallows.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> Samuel Hopkins was a Revolutionary general. He was born in Virginia
and, in 1797 went to Henderson and there represented Richard Henderson
&amp; Co., owners of a large tract of land lying in that section, granted
them by the legislature of Virginia. He continued to make Henderson his
home until 1819, the time of his death. He served several terms in the
Kentucky legislature and from 1813 to 1815 represented his district in Congress.
During the war of 1812 he was commissioned a major-general. [<a href="#B124">124</a>]</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> The recorded expense items show six men were allowed $7.50 each for
guarding the Henderson jail during the ten days the Harpe women were
imprisoned. One man was given $4.32 “for victualling Susannah Harp, et
al. in the jail for eight days.” Andrew Rowan, the sheriff, was allowed
$71.25 “for removing prisoners from Henderson to Logan jail, 190 miles—95
miles one way—and also $4.54 for cash advanced for diet for said prisoners
from Henderson to Logan jail.” Five men were allowed $5.70 each for
guarding the prisoners en route to Russellville. William B. Blackburn, “attorney
for the Commonwealth in this county,” received $60.00 and John D.
Haussmann, the county clerk, and the sheriff, each $30.00 “for his ex-officio
services.” These items, with $4.17 paid the sheriff “for summoning and
attending the court,” make a total of $281.78.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> Maj. William Stewart was one of the most eccentric characters in early
Kentucky history. His life is full of suggestions for romance and song. He
was born in South Carolina about 1772, and, at the age of eighteen, “getting
into some difficulties, he left his native state.” He went to Nashville, says
Finley, and from there started for Henderson—possibly with the intention
of continuing to Cave-in-Rock. On his way north he joined a man and wife
going to the Green River country. To what extent they influenced him is
not known. However, when the three travelers reached the place that later
became Russellville, they decided to settle there. In 1791 he left Logan
County and “after years of toil, hunting, and nobody knows what else, he
finally settled in Stanford and, in 1795, became a dry goods clerk for one
Ballenger”—the same man who, a few years later, went in pursuit of the
Harpes. In 1796 he returned to Logan County and died there in 1852. He
was the first sheriff of Logan County. Collins says: “He was one of the
celebrities of the place ... faithful to his friends, and dangerous to his
foes.”
</p>
<p>
Smith in a chapter devoted to Stewart calls him William Stout: “Always
eccentric in his material and style of dress—often he appeared attired in an
entire suit made of various colored ‘lists,’ taken from the finest broadcloths
sewed together, fantastically cut and fitted to his person, while the buttons
on his coat and pantaloons were quarter dollars, United States coin, with
eyes attached by his own ingenuity (for he was a worker in metals) and
his vest buttoned with genuine United States dimes. This dress, however,
was rather for high days and holidays.... On the morning of the day on
which he died, he, with but little aid, drew on his curiously constituted,
many colored suit of clothes, and in that attire he died and was buried.” [<a href="#B121">121</a>]</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> When, in 1860, the town of Dixon was laid out to be the seat of justice
for the newly established county of Webster, one of the principal streets
forming the court house square was named after John Leiper and another
after Moses Stegall. These pioneers were thus honored, not to show that
“the evil men do lives after them,” but to reward two men whose names
were “linked with one virtue” at least—that of being responsible for the
capture and death of Big Harpe.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> Whether or not the Harpes were brothers and Big Harpe’s two
“wives” were sisters is a question that can never be decided definitely by
history, but it is one over which psychologists may long argue. If the two
men actually were brothers and the two women actually were sisters, it is
an anomaly in nature. The Harpes were not ordinary criminals. They
were abnormalities in a type that is itself abnormal. It is well recognized
that abnormal products of all kinds in nature are exceptions or variations
and are not the rule, and that genius in creation, in destruction, in crime, in
art, etc. is very seldom duplicated by the same parentage. Abnormal criminals
are extremes of a type opposed to abnormal geniuses of the creative or
imaginative type. Brothers or sisters in either class occur seldom, if ever.
For these reasons, a parental connection between the two Harpes and between
the two women may properly be doubted. It is true that Big Harpe
was the heartless leader and that Little Harpe might have been an ordinary
weakling, obedient to Big Harpe because he feared him or because he failed
to recognize the inhumanity of the crimes he was called upon to commit.
No other record is now recalled showing such a horrible partnership between
blood brothers.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> Lewis Collins prints this description of Big Harpe in his edition of
1847, and his son and successor, Richard H. Collins, likewise republished it
in his <cite>History of Kentucky</cite> in 1874. By both it is credited to Colonel James
Davidson. The elder Collins says Colonel Davidson was “personally cognizant
of most of the circumstances.” Judge Hall’s <cite>Harpe’s Head</cite> had been
published in 1833 and there can be no doubt that Colonel Davidson copied
his description of Big Harpe, word for word, from the book, relying upon
Judge Hall’s opportunities for and good character in accuracy.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> It is probable that in the early days many an outlaw was “said to be”
a kinsman of the Harpes. The case of Mrs. George Heatherly, referred to
in the <cite>History of Caldwell and Livingston Counties, Missouri</cite>, 1886, is one
instance discovered. The Heatherly Gang, according to this account, operated
in the Upper Grand River country of northern Missouri in 1836 and a
few years preceding. They robbed many white settlers and often stole
horses from the Indians. “Old George Heatherly was regarded as a thief
in Kentucky and Mrs. Heatherly (his wife) was a sister of the notorious
Kentucky murderers and freebooters, Big and Little Harpe.... Old Mrs.
Heatherly is said to have been the leading spirit of the gang, prompting and
planning many a dark deed, and often assisting in its execution.” There is
no proof advanced, however, that this woman was a sister of the Harpes.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> It is interesting to note that Susan Harpe, wife of Big Harpe, many
years after his death tried to convey the impression that Little Harpe, not
Big Harpe, was the greater villain. Draper, recording some statements made
to him by George Herndon who lived near Russellville, says that Big Harpe’s
wife told Mrs. Herndon that “Big Harpe said to Little Harpe that he thought
they had better quit killing people and go to some backwoods country, for if
they did not, he feared they would be detected and killed. Whereupon, Little
Harpe flew into a passion, cursed his brother for a coward, and said if he
ever talked that way again he would shoot him.” In order to defend him
further, she declared that “Some days before Big Harpe’s death he fancied
the ground continually trembling beneath his feet.” In this way she tried
to show that Big Harpe actually did suffer great fear and remorse of conscience
and insinuated that Little Harpe was beyond the reach of such
feelings. [<a href="#B12F">12F</a>]</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> Family names were spelled indifferently in colonial and republican
times. In the fashion of English speech Meason was pronounced Mason.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> In her account to Draper Mrs. Anthony states that in addition to Henry
Havard, Samuel Mason had, besides his own family, at least two other
accomplices while living near Henderson: Nicholas Welsh and a man named
Hewitt. Henry Havard, after the assassination of Captain John Dunn, fled
to his father’s home on Red River, Tennessee. The regulators there, upon
hearing that he had been employed by Mason to kill Dunn, “raised and went
to old Havard’s, found Henry hid between two feather beds and shot
through the beds. They made the old man pull out the body of his son and
when they found his brains were oozing out they knew he was quite dead.”
Hewitt was captured on the Kentucky shore opposite Diamond Island, by
regulators who were “strongly inclined to kill him, but finally refrained, but
made him break his gun.” Nicholas Welsh, who ran the tavern in which
Mason and his men made their headquarters when in Red Banks, disappeared
immediately after Captain John Dunn was shot, and was never
again heard of.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> One of Mason’s daughters-in-law, Mrs. Tom Mason, continued to live
for a short time at the Rocky Springs rendezvous after the camp had been
abandoned by the others, who rightly suspected that the governor’s reward
would result in a thorough search along the Trace. It is possible Mrs.
Mason’s condition made flight impossible, but it is more probable she concluded
to remain behind and, in time, find a home in some law-abiding community.
Guild, who interviewed Swaney, gives us only one glimpse of this
woman:
</p>
<p>
“After the band had left she started to the Chickasaw Agency where she
would be able to communicate with her friends. When Mr. Swaney met
her she was on her way, carrying her babe, together with some provisions.
Mrs. Mason begged Mr. Swaney to assist her.... He spent nearly a whole
day in assisting the woman, and then made up lost time by riding all night.
Mrs. Mason told Mr. Swaney that Mason’s band was safe out of reach of
their pursuers, and that before leaving they buried their gold in the bottoms
near the river and cut the initials ‘T.M.’ on trees near the spot so they could
easily find it in the future.”
</p>
<p>
According to one tradition [<a href="#B114">114</a>] Mason crossed the Mississippi River and
went westward to the highlands northwest of Vicksburg “which are known
to this day as Mason Hills” and there hid some booty. “To the present day,”
continues this chronicle, “many people believe that rich treasures lie buried
out in the Mason Hills.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> Cramer’s <cite>Navigator</cite>, 1818, says: “Stack or Crow’s Nest Island has been
sunk by the earthquake [of 1811] or swept by the floods.... Stack not long
since was famed for a band of counterfeiters, horse thieves, robbers, murderers,
etc. who made this part of the Mississippi a place of manufacture
and deposit. From hence they would sally forth, stop boats, buy horses,
flour, whiskey, etc. and pay for all in fine, new notes of the ‘<em>first water</em>.’
Their villainies (after many severe losses sustained by innocent, good men,
unsuspecting the cheat) became notorious, and after several years’ search
and pursuit of the civil law, and in some cases the <em>club-law</em>, against this
band of monsters, they have at length disappeared.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> The author is indebted to Dr. Dunbar Rowland, of the Mississippi Department
of Archives and History, for the privilege of having a translation
made of the record of Mason’s trial.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> Samuel Mason probably had heard of “money growing on trees.” It
was a common practice for travelers to hide their money over night in the
bushes near the place they camped. It is likely that Mason sometimes
“found” the money of highway travelers while they were asleep, or “found”
it after he had surprised the campers and driven them off before they could
procure their brush-hidden valuables.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> The story of John Setton’s life up to this time, as recited by Setton himself,
doubtless appeared very plausible to the officials. There was, nevertheless,
very little truth in it. This court identified him by the names Setton,
Taylor, and Wells. It apparently disregarded Samuel Mason’s statement
that the prisoner sometimes went by other names which he, Mason, could
not recall. These three names were equally unfamiliar; none were connected
with the known history of any crime. Mason himself may have been ignorant
of the real name and true history of Setton. Be that as it may, Draper in
one of his early note books, written about 1840, gives the following facts
regarding the man who passed as one John Setton and whose identity, it
seems, was then unknown by the historian himself. He states that John
Setton was originally from North Carolina and, while traveling along the
Natchez Trace, lingering more or less among the Indians, he fell in company
with a young man named Bass, who lived in Williamson County, Tennessee.
Then, in the words of Draper:
</p>
<p>
“Bass was not very well and Setton, very friendly, would catch Bass’ horse
and do him other offices of kindness. When Bass reached his father’s residence
he invited Setton to sojourn a time, recruit his horse, etc. Setton did
so and courted a sister of young Bass and married her. He started with
his new wife for North Carolina. When they reached the North Fork of
Holston, in Hawkins County, East Tennessee, Setton gave information that
his wife’s horse ran away and her feet being in the stirrups, had dragged
and killed her. This is the story he told negroes. The white persons being
absent from home, he had his deceased companion buried hurriedly. He
disposed of her clothing and saddle for little or nothing and in a few hours
put off with both horses. After he had gone, his conduct led some of the
people thereabout to disinter the dead body, and found she had evidently
been killed by heavy blows on the head. Setton fled, went first to Louisiana,
then down the river, enlisted at Fort Pickering at the Chickasaw Bluffs
(Memphis) into Captain Richard Sparks’ company. By his conduct he was
soon made a sergeant. He was in the habit of going out hunting. One day
he borrowed Captain Sparks’ elegant rifle, took a canoe and some provisions
and started on a several days hunt down the Mississippi. Setton steered up
the Arkansas and then joined Mason.” [<a href="#B12H">12H</a>]</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> Nothing in the records indicates whether or not the officials recognized
the connection in the testimony given by the Masons and Setton.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_29" href="#FNanchor_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> Practically all the province of Louisiana, including New Orleans, was
transferred from France to Spain in 1769. Spain secretly ceded the same
territory to France September 1, 1800, but the French did not take formal
possession until November 30, 1803. On April 30, 1803, or about seven
months before this formality was performed, Napoleon secretly sold Louisiana
to the United States and accordingly, December 20, 1803, at New Orleans,
lower Louisiana was formally transferred to the American Republic, and
March 9, 1804, at St. Louis, the same ceremony took place for upper Louisiana,
which included New Madrid.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_30" href="#FNanchor_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> Under what circumstances Mason was trapped by May and Setton and
whether or not he really knew by whom he was snared has not been ascertained.
Mrs. William Anthony, in her letter to Draper, states that on one
occasion when Mason and his party were crossing the Mississippi River,
May was acting as ferryman and “Mason said the others might all go over
first and he would remain till last. When all were over but Mason, May
returned for him, and as Mason was alone with his bag of money, May
killed him and took the head to Natchez.”
</p>
<p>
Audubon, in one of his <cite>Journals</cite> under the head of “Regulators” gives
another version: “At last a body of Regulators undertook, at great peril, and
for the sake of the country, to bring the villain to punishment.... One day
as he was riding a beautiful horse in the woods he was met by one of the
Regulators, who immediately recognized him, but passed him as if an utter
stranger. Mason, not dreaming of danger, pursued his way leisurely, as if
he had met no one.... At dusk, Mason, having reached the lowest part
of a ravine, no doubt well known to him, hoppled (tied together the forelegs
of) his stolen horse, to enable it to feed during the night without chance
of straying far, and concealed himself in a hollow log to spend the night.
The plan was good but proved his ruin. The Regulator, who knew every
hill and hollow of the woods, marked the place and the log with the eye of
an experienced hunter, and as he remarked that Mason was most efficiently
armed, he galloped off to the nearest house where he knew he should find
assistance. This was easily procured, and the party proceeded to the spot.
Mason, on being attacked, defended himself with desperate valor; and as it
proved impossible to secure him alive he was brought to the ground with a
rifle ball. His head was cut off, and stuck on the end of a broken branch of
a tree, by the nearest road to the place where the affray happened. The
gang soon dispersed, in consequence of the loss of their leader, and this
infliction of merited punishment proved beneficial in deterring others from
following a similar predatory life.”
</p>
<p>
Such may have been the end of one of the sons of Mason. There is nothing
in history or tradition connecting this act of the Regulators with the career
of Samuel Mason.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_31" href="#FNanchor_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> All the early records prove beyond a doubt that John Setton and Wiley
Harpe or “Little” Harpe were one and the same man. A few of the later
writers confuse May and Setton and, apparently as a result of a superficial
knowledge of the careers of these outlaws, state that Wiley Harpe had
assumed the name of one May.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_32" href="#FNanchor_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> The counsel for the defense evidently objected to the jurisdiction of the
court, claiming that the alleged “robberies by Mason’s men” did not occur
within the bounds of Mississippi Territory. The question of jurisdiction is
commented on in two of the letters written in 1804 by Thomas Rodney to
Caesar A. Rodney. [<a href="#B52">52</a>]</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_33" href="#FNanchor_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> Greenville, originally called Hunston, was an important town on the
old Natchez Trace. It lay about twenty-five miles northeast of Natchez,
and was a thriving village as early as 1798, when the United States took
possession of Mississippi Territory. A number of the state’s wealthiest and
most aristocratic pioneers lived in or near the town. In 1825 the seat of
justice was moved from Greenville to Fayette and soon thereafter the old
town passed out of existence. The site of old Greenville has been under
cultivation for many years. The court house and the jail stood in what is
now known as “Courthouse Field.”
</p>
<p>
The city of Greenville, Mississippi, on the Mississippi River, which was
established long after old Greenville became an extinct town, is a thriving
place of more than 10,000 inhabitants.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_34" href="#FNanchor_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> What became of Mason’s men is not known. A frontier rowdy named
Edward Rose is described in Washington Irving’s Astoria. Lyman C. Draper
wrote on the fly-leaf of his copy of this book that “Rose was probably one of
Mason’s gang.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_35" href="#FNanchor_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> Finley says Philip Alston was born in South Carolina and in early manhood
became “a full grown counterfeiter.” After living in Natchez and
“attaining to the highest respectability ... his avaricious eye rested on a
golden image of the Savior, in the Catholic Church, ... and he went immediately
and counterfeited some coins from it.” He fled from Natchez to
Kentucky and settled in Logan County, where he established a salt works and
store at Moat’s Lick. While running these he managed the Cedar House, a
tavern near Russellville. He also farmed, preached, and taught school, and
incidentally “flooded the country with spurious money.” Thus he became,
“not only the first farmer, manufacturer, and merchant, but he established
the first depot of exchange and the first bank, and also the first mint in
western Kentucky.” About 1788, “the whole people rose up in their majesty
and banished him.” He next appeared in Livingston and Henderson counties
and then fled to Cave-in-Rock. After a short stay at the Cave he returned
to Natchez where “he found his old enemies, who became his fast friends.
He rose in the estimation of the Spaniards until he was appointed an <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">empresidio</i>
of Mexico, when in the midst of his success and returning fortune death
stepped in and sealed his fate.”
</p>
<p>
Finley, who never cites authorities, states that “Peter Alston, Philip
Alston’s youngest son, became an outlaw and robber, and joined Mason’s
band at Cave-in-the-Rock and was allied to the Harpes, and with one of the
Harpes was executed at Washington, Mississippi ... for the killing of his
chief, Mason, for the reward.” No records have been found that contradict
any of Finley’s statements, except the one to the effect that Peter Alston
killed Samuel Mason.
</p>
<p>
Nancy Huston Banks in her novel <cite>’Round Anvil Rock</cite> presents Philip
Alston as a kind but mysterious gentleman who, although generally trusted
by the community, is regarded by some with suspicion because of his frequent
absences and ever-replenished supply of imported cloth, laces, and jewelry.
In the novel Alston refers to Jean Lafitte as “my resepected and trusted
friend,” and admits that he, Alston, makes business trips to Duff’s Fort, near
Cave-in-Rock, although “it was no longer a secret that regular stations of
outlawry were firmly established between Natchez on the one side and Duff’s
Fort on the other.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_36" href="#FNanchor_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> Duff secured metal from the veins of lead ore on the Saline and, as it
contained a little silver, he separated the silver from the lead as best he
could and made counterfeit coins. In this connection the author of <cite>A History
of Union County, Kentucky</cite>, further comments:
</p>
<p>
“The traditions of Duff’s great wealth have acted upon many of the
citizens of Caseyville much as the tales of Captain Kidd’s plunder affected
the inhabitants of Long Island. Youthful imaginations have been inflamed
with thoughts of the fabulous wealth stored away in some cavern along the
Caseyville cliffs. Many a ramble has turned into a search for the caves in
that vicinity, but so far as the public knows, none of them has ever eventuated
in any discoveries.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_36A" href="#FNanchor_36A" class="fnanchor">36a</a> Sturdevant’s stockaded fort stood on the long bluff immediately above
what later became the town of Rosiclare, Illinois, and commanded a good
view of the Ohio. Dr. Daniel Lawrence, of Golconda, saw the ruins of the
Sturdevant house as late as 1876. The place had then been in a dilapidated
condition for some time, but enough remained to show that in its day it was
a substantial log structure, a story and a half high, with three rooms on the
ground floor, including a log L on the north side. Digging into some of the
old logs, he discovered many small holes made by bullets. A new stone
quarry was in operation at the time of his visit and he was present when a
blast blew out of a crevice a set of dies for making counterfeit half dollars.
The foreman took the plates home for souvenirs, but their whereabouts is
now unknown.</p></div>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_37" href="#FNanchor_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> The <cite>Chicago Times</cite> published an article July 17, 1879, entitled “Hell
on the Ohio,” which, in 1888, was republished in <cite>The Life of Logan Belt</cite>,
a book by Shadrack L. Jackson, who then lived in the village of Cave-in-Rock.
This distorted account of Ford is here reprinted as an example of
one of the many absurd and almost groundless stories that have gained
wide circulation:
</p>
<p>
“Not far from Cave-in-Rock is Ford’s Ferry, which gets its name from
a man who was one of the noted criminals of pioneer history. He lived on
the Kentucky side about two miles above Cave-in-Rock and was ostensibly
a farmer, owning a large tract of land. He also kept a hotel. Ford was
always surrounded by a gang of desperate men, highwaymen and murderers,
and, while nothing was ever proved on him, he was looked upon as equal
to his companions in guilt. He was a robber of flatboats and of emigrants.
Dead bodies were found near his house, and isolated and freshly made
graves were discovered in that neighborhood. Men were known to start
West with a little money, to locate, and were never after heard of. Their
friends would inquire, follow them to Ford’s and there lose all traces of them.
It was one of his habits to cut down trees and obstruct the road to rival
ferries, until the owners would be compelled to quit and leave, thinking
retaliation only a means of provoking death. But Ford brought on himself
the penalty of his lawlessness.
</p>
<p>
“An old feud existed between him and the father-in-law of a man named
Simpson, and Ford killed his enemy. Simpson gathered a crowd of friends
and went armed to Ford’s house for the purpose of killing him. They found
him on the Illinois side loading a boat. He knew at once why they had
come, begged for his life and appealed for protection to one of their number,
Jonathan Brown by name. Brown was touched by the appeal and interceded
for the terrified man. The plea was so far successful that the crowd
waited two or three hours, but when darkness came, they took him out and
shot him dead when he was begging hardest to be spared. It is said that
none of the crowd proper did the shooting, but that Simpson compelled his
negro to do the deed.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_38" href="#FNanchor_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> It may be proper here to record that descendants of James Ford, like
the descendants of other crude but strong pioneer stock, rose to deserved
prominence in the business and social life of several western cities. The
family is scattered, but the respect its members command and the success they
have achieved bears testimony to the strain of ability and energy inherent in
the blood. It leads also to deeper consideration of one of the theories in the
Ford’s Ferry mystery, that James Ford was perhaps a victim of circumstances
growing out of his peculiar personality in a dangerous surrounding.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_39" href="#FNanchor_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> The crime was committed in that part of Gallatin County which in
1839 (when Hardin County was formed out of parts of Gallatin and Pope
counties) became the eastern portion of Hardin. Previous to the organization
of Hardin, Cave-in-Rock was a “corner” at the southern extremity of
the line separating the two original counties.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_40" href="#FNanchor_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> The fact that the names Murrell and Mason sound somewhat alike is
sometimes the cause of confusion. For example, occasionally one hears that
Little Harpe cut off the head of Murrell, whereas Harpe was hanged when
Murrell was four or five years old.
</p>
<p>
On a map of the Ohio, compiled 1911–14 under the supervision of the
Ohio River Board of Engineers on Locks and Dams, Cave-in-Rock is
erroneously designated Merrell’s [sic] Cave.
</p>
<p>
One absurd tradition has it that James Ford’s first wife was a sister of
Murrell, and another is to the effect that both Ford and his wife were related
to Mason, Murrell, and the Harpes.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_41" href="#FNanchor_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> An exhaustive search through the fiction printed during the first part
of last century probably would result in finding all the Cave-in-Rock tales
referred to by early writers.
</p>
<p>
Henry R. Schoolcraft visited the Cave in 1818 and in his <cite>Personal
Memoirs</cite> commented that “as a scene of a tale of imaginative robber-life
it appeared to me to possess great attractions.” Later in his book entitled
<cite>The Indian in His Wigwam</cite> he adds: “The Cave’s associations of the early
robber era ... have been commemorated by the pen of fiction of Charles
Brockden Brown.” In 1834 Charles Fenno Hoffman writes that “its peculiar
form has suggested one of the most agreeable tales to an admired Western
writer.” Edmund Flagg, in <cite>The Far West</cite>, written in 1836, states that
murdering and boat robbing perpetrated at the Cave by Samuel Mason and
his band “has suggested a spirited tale from a popular writer.”
</p>
<p>
Judge James Hall wrote for a number of magazines. Among his articles
may be one on the outlaws at Cave-in-Rock, or a story in which he pictures
the activities of the Harpes, the Masons, and others during their stay there.
My search for any of his Cave sketches has been fruitless.</p></div>

<h2 class="nobreak p1" id="Transcribers_Notes">Transcriber’s Notes</h2>

<p>Punctuation, hyphenation, and spelling were made
consistent when a predominant preference was found
in the original book; otherwise they were not changed.</p>

<p>Spelling errors and inconsistencies within quoted
passages have not been changed.</p>

<p>Simple typographical errors were corrected; unbalanced
quotation marks were remedied when the change was
obvious, and otherwise left unbalanced.</p>

<p>Illustrations in this eBook have been positioned
between paragraphs and outside quotations. In versions
of this eBook that support hyperlinks, the page
references in the List of Illustrations lead to the
corresponding illustrations.</p>

<p>Footnotes, originally at the bottoms of pages, have been
collected and placed after the Bibliography.</p>

<p>The index was not checked for proper alphabetization
or correct page references.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_15">Page 15</a> explains that numbers in brackets
refer to Bibliography entries. One of the Transcribers has
determined that, in the Index, a page number in square brackets
means that on that page is a reference to the source that is cited
using the Bibliography number. For example, the above entry for
“<a href="#Withers_Alexander_S">Withers, Alexander S.</a>”, refers
to “[162]” and that page has a Bibliography reference to “[140]”,
which is “Withers, Alexander S. Chronicles of Border Warfare”.</p>
